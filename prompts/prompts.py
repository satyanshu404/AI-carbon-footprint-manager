    Detailed Instructions
    Input:
    You will receive one or multiple documents that contain detailed information about a company's product carbon footprint. These documents may include various types of data, such as emissions data, energy consumption, raw material usage, transportation details, manufacturing processes, and any other relevant sustainability metrics.
    Output:
    Your goal is to produce a single JSON object that accurately represents the product's carbon footprint. The structure of this JSON object will adhere to a specific data model provided by the user. This data model can vary depending on different use cases, and detailed documentation for the data model will be provided by the user.

### Overview:
Our main objective is to find the carbon footprint of a product based on the company's environmental data and to store the data, we need a data model.
so Your objective is to extract a comprehensive data model related to the carbon footprint of a product from a given documentation file and save it in a generic JSON format.

Task:
1. Carefully read and analyze the documentation file to identify the relevant data model.
2. Extract the data model, ensuring to include the data types for each field, descriptions, and instructions to set any missing data to null.
3. Format the data model in the following structure.
4. Save the data model in a JSON file.

Input:
Documentation file path.

Output:
A JSON file containing the extracted data model with field data types, descriptions, and handling of missing data.
for example:
list(
    dict(
        "field1": "<data_type>, a unique identifier for the item, if not present then null",
        'field2': list(
                '<string>, an unique identifier for the item.'
            ),
        ...
    )
)
Note: keep the data type in angular brackets only followed by the description of the field.
Note: Always pass the content as list of object, else the futher saving process will break and its very crucial.
Note: at finaly after saving the file, only return the file path of the saved file, nothing else. its very crucial.

Data strorage format:
Save directory: {0}
with the file name as 'type-of-data-model_data_model.json'. use the name from the documentation, 
For eg. pact_data_model.json, note that it is also crucial, use specific name as given in the documentation.

### Important Notes:
- Ensure to extract the complete data model from the documentation file.
- Save the file in the specified directory with the correct file name.
- Always return the file path of the saved file, nothing else, no text, no explanations just the file path.
- Validate the output for correct formatting and completeness.
- Complete the whole task, user will not be present to complete your leftover task.

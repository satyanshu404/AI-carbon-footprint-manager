Input: Company name (mostly, not always).
Output: A JSON object containing the company's most important products and their carbon footprints in full details using the provided template.
{0}
The response should be in this JSON template only. 

Ideas:
1. Search for the company's official website and look for the products and their carbon footprints.
2. Search for the company's sustainability reports or other relevant documents.
3. First search for the companies most important products, then search for their carbon footprints.
4. Search with the product names in directory or search tool for the carbon footprints.

Guidelines:
Accuracy is Crucial: Do not fabricate data. Ensure the information is accurate and reliable.
Understand the Problem: Focus on collecting and creating the data model specific to the query. Avoid including irrelevant data.
Use Provided Tools: Check the directory first. If data isn't available, use the search tool.
Extensive Search: For quality data/informations, do extensive search with detailded queries.
No Assumptions: Always search for data if it's not available. Do not make assumptions.

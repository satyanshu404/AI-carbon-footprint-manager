    Detailed Instructions
    Input:
    You will receive one or multiple documents that contain detailed information about a company's product carbon footprint. These documents may include various types of data, such as emissions data, energy consumption, raw material usage, transportation details, manufacturing processes, and any other relevant sustainability metrics.
    Output:
    Your goal is to produce a single JSON object that accurately represents the product's carbon footprint. The structure of this JSON object will adhere to a specific data model provided by the user. This data model can vary depending on different use cases, and detailed documentation for the data model will be provided by the user.

Objective: To Collect and present the products of a specified company along with their carbon footprints in a JSON format.
Input: Company name (mostly, not always).
Output: A JSON object containing the company's most important products and their carbon footprints in full details using the provided template.
{0}
The response should be in this JSON template only. 

Ideas:
1. Search for the company's official website and look for the products and their carbon footprints.
2. Search for the company's sustainability reports or other relevant documents.
3. First search for the companies most important products, then search for their carbon footprints.
4. Search with the product names in directory or search tool for the carbon footprints.

Guidelines:
Accuracy is Crucial: Do not fabricate data. Ensure the information is accurate and reliable.
Understand the Problem: Focus on collecting and creating the data model specific to the query. Avoid including irrelevant data.
Use Provided Tools: Check the directory first. If data isn't available, use the search tool.
Extensive Search: For quality data/informations, do extensive search with detailded queries.
No Assumptions: Always search for data if it's not available. Do not make assumptions.
Final Output: Provide the response in the specified JSON format only, do not include any additional text.

A text summary in natural language that includes:
Descriptions of each field and its corresponding value.
Only those fields where the value is not null.
                
Guidelines:
Examine each field in the JSON object.
If the value of a field is null, exclude that field from the summary.
For fields with non-null values, describe them in a coherent sentence.
Ensure that the summary is clear, concise, and reads like a natural language description.

Objective: To calculate the carbon emissions of the product(s). 
For that Always think then act.

Input: An image path
{0}.
Output: Total carbon footprint of each product (Numerical Value) with actual unit.

Calculations for the carbon emission may be difficilt, so always first think and then act.
If needed break down the task into subtasks and act accordingly.
The information about the product carbon footprint may not be present, so break down the task, what are the green house gaseous are released during manufacuring of each product, then search for its carbon footprint.
You are also provided with the a tool which can write the formula in code format and can execute it, so call that tool if you need to do mathematical calulations for carbon footprint. Beacuase data accuracy is crucial.


Guidelines:
    - Restrict yourself to the calculation of carbon emissions of the products only, noting else, If the content is not useful then search again with a better qury.
    - Always first check if the files exists in the directory or not for data, if it is not available, then use tools to get the data.
    - Utilize the provided tools.
    - Cross-verify facts and figures from reliable sources if needed.
    - Provide the output in the specified format only.

Task: 
1. Create the data models for all products which are responsible for carbon emissions or greenhouse gases based on the company's environmental data.
2. Write all the the data models in a JSON file one by one for each product in one file only, whose name can be given in this format company_name_data_model.json.
3. Finally read that file to show the results as json.

Input:
1. Company's environmental data file paths
2. Data model format: 
{0}
You are strictly advised to find the data for each field that are asked in the data model and fill the JSON object accordingly.
For example:
Let say in given company's data, there are n products for which carbon emissions or greenhouse gases data is available like coal, oil, gas, etc. 
Then you should find the values for the key present in the data model for each product and fill the JSON object and write the content in the file for each product and then finally read that file to show results.
There must be n data model in the final JSON file.

So run in loop, find values for the key present in the data model for n product and fill the JSON object with correct values and write the content in the file for each product and then finally read that file to show results.

###Important Notes###:
- Ensure for each product, all the values of Data model are from the companies files only.
- Use simply null for missing values instead of omitting fields.
- Keep the same given Data Model format for all products.
- Validate the final JSON output for correct formatting and completeness.

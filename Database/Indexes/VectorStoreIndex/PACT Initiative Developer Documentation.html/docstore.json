Introduction\nThis document aims to provide guidance to those developing PACT Conformant Solutions.\nIt is not self-contained and does not replace the Technical Specifications.\nIt can nevertheless be used as the main source for developers, as it links to the Technical Specifications whenever needed.\n1.1. Our goal\nThe Partnership for Carbon Transparency (PACT) seeks to accelerate decarbonization through the creation of transparency on emissions in the value chain.\nFor that end, we need an open and global network of interoperable solutions for the secure, peer-to-peer exchange of accurate, primary and verified product emissions data \u2014 across all industries and value chains.\nThe \u00a7\u202f1.2 Pathfinder Network aims at being precisely this network of interoperable solutions.\nIn order to establish it and take it further, we propose the adoption of the \u00a7\u202f1.3 Pathfinder Framework methodology.\nFollowing it, we shall be able to exchange \u00a7\u202f1.4 Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)s through entire supply and value chains, hopefully reaching net zero emissions before 2050.\n1.2. Pathfinder Network\nThe Pathfinder Network is a concept created by the Partnership for Carbon Transparency and powered by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).\nIt refers to the data exchange infrastructure that enables organizations to connect across value chains and industries to share Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) data.\nThe Network creates interoperability between technology solutions and industry-focused data exchange platforms, meaning organizations are flexible in their choice of provider.\nIt can be seen as a sort of convener or facilitator.\nIn the simplest of terms, through the Pathfinder Network, we aim to create the \u201cinternet for emissions data\u201d \u2014 the common nexus for all organizations to connect seamlessly, exchange and derive insights from emissions data.\n1.3. Pathfinder Framework\nThe Pathfinder Framework provides industry-agnostic methodological guidance for the calculation of product-level emissions data.\nThe adoption of the methodology described in Pathfinder Framework:  Guidance for the Accounting and Exchange of Product Life Cycle Emissions makes it possible to exchange Product Carbon Footprint data, hence being essential for the establishment and growth of the Pathfinder Network.\nThe technical counterpart of this methodology is described in detail in the Technical Specifications, which will be referred to several times throughout this document.\n1.4. Product Carbon Footprint (PCF)\nA Product Carbon Footprint is the carbon (equivalent) emissions relating to a product.\nProducts can be any kind of item exchanged between entities, including \u201cpieces\u201d, metric or volumetric quantities of a product, etc.", "start_char_idx": 3, "end_char_idx": 4427, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05d65700-e0d6-45f2-8d0b-20717a970123": {"__data__": {"id_": "05d65700-e0d6-45f2-8d0b-20717a970123", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "**Comprehensive Guide to Implementing and Exchanging Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) via the Pathfinder Network: Authentication, Data Fetching, and API Endpoints**", "prev_section_summary": "### Summary:\n\nThe excerpt from the document titled **\"Comprehensive Guide to Implementing and Exchanging Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) via the Pathfinder Network: Authentication, Data Fetching, and API Endpoints\"** outlines the following key topics and entities:\n\n1. **PACT Initiative Developer Documentation**:\n   -

What do I need to implement to exchange PCFs through the Pathfinder Network?\nIn order to exchange Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) data through the Pathfinder Network, a\nsolution must conform to the Pathfinder Technical\nSpecifications. In a nutshell, this amounts to\nimplementing an HTTP REST API, with three mandatory actions (\u00a7\u202f3.1.1 Authenticate, \u00a7\u202f3.1.2 ListFootprints,\nand \u00a7\u202f3.1.3 GetFootprint) and one optional action (\u00a7\u202f3.2.1 Events). Below (in section \u00a7\u202f2 Example API - Plug and Play)\nyou will find an example API which should give you a more concrete idea of what is required. You\nwill also find detailed instructions on how to build your own solution\u2019s API (in section \u00a7\u202f3 Overview of the Technical Specification), by repeatedly referring to the Technical Specifications. In the appendix, you will\nalso find references to documentation that will help you make sure your solution meets the necessary\nrequirements.\nOnce your solution is ready, please join our regular Connect Hub to finish testing with partners and become a PACT Conformant\nsolution.\n2. Example API - Plug and Play\nThe following is an example implementation of an HTTP REST API conforming to the Pathfinder Technical Specifications.\nA demo version of this API is available at https://api.pathfinder.sine.dev and will be used in all examples below.\nIf you want to run the example API locally, you can also do so, by cloning this repository and following the instructions provided here.\nA Swagger UI visualization is available here.\nBellow is a list of all endpoints exposed by this example:\n\n/2/auth/token \u2014 implements \u00a7\u202f2.1 Authentication\n/2/footprints \u2014 implements \u00a7\u202f2.2.1 ListFootprints (but not yet the filter option) \n    /2/footprints/<footprint-id> \u2014 implements \u00a7\u202f2.2.2 GetFootprint\n/2/events \u2014 implements \u00a7\u202f2.3 Sending an event\n/openapi.json \u2014 OpenAPI description file \n    /swagger-ui \u2014 Swagger UI visualization \n   \n2.1.

Overview of the Technical Specification\nThe Technical Specification specifies a data model for GHG emission data at product level based on the Pathfinder Framework Version 2, and a protocol for interoperable exchange of GHG emission data at product level.\nTo allow for interoperable PCF data exchange, solutions must implement an HTTP REST API, also defined in the technical specification.\nThe scope of the HTTP API is minimal by design and new features will be added in future versions of the specification.\nIn order to be conformant with the Pathfinder Framework, a solution\u2019s HTTP REST API must include the following mandatory features:\n\n \u00a7\u202f3.1.1 Authenticate\n \u00a7\u202f3.1.2 ListFootprints\n \u00a7\u202f3.1.3 GetFootprint\n\nThere is also a recommended but optional feature:\n\n \u00a7\u202f3.2.1 Events\n\nFurther details about the HTTP REST API can be found in Section 6 (HTTP REST API) of the Technical Specification.\n3.1. Mandatory Functionality\n3.1.1. Authenticate\nThe HTTP REST API requires users to authenticate themselves before they are able to either fetch data (see \u00a7\u202f3.1.2 ListFootprints and \u00a7\u202f3.1.3 GetFootprint) or submit a events (see \u00a7\u202f3.2.1 Events).\nThe Authenticate action is mandatory and must be implemented in accordance with RFC6749, Section 4.4 (OAuth2 Client Credentials).\nThe solution provider must register users by exchanging credentials with them.\nThese must include an id (aka client_id / username) and a secret (aka client_secret / username).\nThe solution provider is free to manage credentials as they please.\n(As a suggestion, we propose that for the time being these are exchanged via e-mail, with the user sending the solution provider what they wish to use as their id and secret and the solution provider confirming them.)\n3.1.1.1. Authentication Flow\nThe Authentication Flow was updated from v. 2.0.1 to v. 2.1.0 of the Technical Specifications.\nIn v. 2.0.1, access\ntokens had to be obtained through a POST request to the /auth/token endpoint.\nIn v.2.1.0, the\nendpoint to retrieve an access token can be chosen by the solution provider (in accordance with RFC6749), provided that:", "start_char_idx": 13472, "end_char_idx": 16649, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11e1cb8f-c015-4469-a6e5-29e2e181d215": {"__data__": {"id_": "11e1cb8f-c015-4469-a6e5-29e2e181d215", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "**Comprehensive Guide to Implementing and Exchanging Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) via the Pathfinder Network: Authentication, Data Fetching, and API Endpoints**", "prev_section_summary": "### Summary:\n\nThe section from the document titled **\"Comprehensive Guide to Implementing and Exchanging Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) via the Pathfinder Network: Authentication, Data Fetching, and API Endpoints\"** covers the following key topics and entities:\n\n1. **Events Endpoint**:\n   -

See \u00a7\u202f3.3 Error Responses.\n3.2.1. Events\nThe Events action is optional and fulfills two purposes, depending on the body of the HTTP request:\n\n The Events action either allows the solution to be notified of an update to one or more ProductFootprint (see here when and why a ProductFootprint might be updated).\n    The body of the HTTP request is a PF Update Event in this case; \n     or, it allows the solution to receive a request to send ProductFootprint data to that data recipient's Events action endpoint.\n    In this case, there are two HTTP requests.

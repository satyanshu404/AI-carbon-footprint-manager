This is clear from the \nannouncements made by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. Today, \ngreenhouse gas emissions have become central to any discussion on energy system choices. Technological progress \nhas brought to the fore a growing number of technologies that can be adopted at a commercial scale. Furthermore, \nthere is urgent need to eliminate the dependence on fossil fuels. \nWe are pitching for energy transition in international forums and displaying that intent in our domestic policies. India \nhas aimed high, decarbonizing 50% of its energy by 2030. Innovative policies to avoid dependency on fossil fuels \nand ensure long-term sustainability are required. In addition to this, investment in R&D has to be scaled up. Domestic \nmanufacturing also needs appropriate incentives to become Aatma Nirbhar Bharat.\nEnergy is at the heart of economic development and perhaps no country is more challenged than India as it strives to \ncreate a better life for its population of almost 1.4 billion people. The Discussion Paper makes a constructive contribution \nto the public debate on the range of issues, which need to be addressed for the achievement of the highly ambitious \n2030 goals set by the Prime Minister.\nWe look forward to engaging closely with multiple stakeholders in the coming years and working towards achieving \nIndia\u2019s energy ambitions that require an unprecedented scale of transformation along a pathway never followed by \nother countries of rapidly increasing energy consumption and decarbonizing energy at the same time. \nDr Vibha Dhawan  \nDirector General  \nThe Energy and Resources Institute \n(TERI) \niv\nPREFACE \nThe electricity sector in India has undergone rapid transformation in recent decades. The country has successfully \nelectrified all households. There is adequate power generating capacity whose optimal utilization is facilitated by \nan integrated national grid. The per capita electricity consumption in India stands at 1208 kWh up from 559 kWh in \n2001. This would increase at least three times as India\u2019s economic development gathers greater momentum and living \nstandards of its citizens rise in the coming decades. Reliable, affordable, quality, round-the-clock power supply to all is \nthe goal to be achieved in the next few years. \nIndia is now committed to the energy transition of decarbonization and achieving a state of net zero emission. India \nhas made remarkable progress in recent years. It now has the 5th largest solar and 4th largest wind power capacity in \nthe world, with their total capacity being over 100 GW. Though the share of renewables in total electricity generation \nis now over 10%, more than 70% of the country\u2019s electricity was still generated by fossil fuels in 2021.1 \nAt COP26, India announced the highly ambitious goal of decarbonizing energy to 50% and achieving 500 GW of \nfossil fuel free generating capacity by 2030. This was a very large increase above its Paris commitments, far more than \nexpected.\nThis paper examines the challenges in achieving the ambitious 2030 targets and discusses feasible pathways for \nachieving these.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4177, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee8ccee5-5c83-439a-b79b-35c3f2bcd262": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee8ccee5-5c83-439a-b79b-35c3f2bcd262", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "\"India's Roadmap to 2030 Decarbonization: Challenges, Pathways, and Policy Innovations in Renewable Energy Growth and Storage Technologies\"", "prev_section_summary": "### Summary:\n\nThe section from the document titled \"India's Roadmap to 2030 Decarbonization: Challenges, Pathways, and Policy Innovations in Renewable Energy Growth and Storage Technologies\" discusses India's ambitious goals for decarbonization by 2030.

non-fossil fuel capacity and meeting \n50% of energy requirements from renewables by 2030 are achievable. However, this would be very challenging. It may \nwell turn out to be a lower cost pathway for meeting growing energy demand and thus, serving the socio-economic \nimperatives of a developing country. \nThe pace of installation of renewables, which has been high, would have to be accelerated very rapidly. Larger shares \nof variable renewable energy (VRE) need greater flexibility and resilience in grid management, creation of large-\nscale storage would be essential for providing this resilience and also for fully utilizing the huge increase in solar \npower generation. Fortunately, solar power with storage has now become cheaper than electricity from new thermal  \npower plants.\nAchieving India\u2019s 2030 Targets:\n1.", "start_char_idx": 7433, "end_char_idx": 11525, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ced82fe-8c49-41da-bec2-c2ffa10ec108": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ced82fe-8c49-41da-bec2-c2ffa10ec108", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "\"India's Roadmap to 2030 Decarbonization: Challenges, Pathways, and Policy Innovations in Renewable Energy Growth and Storage Technologies\"", "prev_section_summary": "### Summary:\n\nThe section titled \"India's Roadmap to 2030 Decarbonization: Challenges, Pathways, and Policy Innovations in Renewable Energy Growth and Storage Technologies\" discusses India's ambitious goals for renewable energy and decarbonization by 2030.

It did not provide direct financial assistance to wind power projects but gave huge post-tax benefits to \nthe investor. The mechanism attracted investments from high net worth individuals (HNIs), corporations, and\u00a0small- \nand medium-sized enterprises (Chaurasiya, et al ., 2019).  Private sector investment in captive wind farms began to \nsurge. These investors harnessed wind energy to meet their captive demand and also used it as an instrument to offset \nthe profits from their other businesses and paid less tax. Private investments created the domestic market for wind \nturbines, which in turn led to the growth of the manufacturing industry and other allied services. During the initial \nyears, wind power plants were set up primarily for captive consumption. During 2004 to 2014, the wind sector grew at \nthe phenomenal compounded annual growth rate of 24%.8\nThe provision of accelerated depreciation (AD) was withdrawn in 2012 as it was felt that this gave excessive benefits. \nAfter a two-year gap, AD was reinstated in 2014.6 In April 2017, the accelerated depreciation rate was lowered to 40%.7 \nVarious studies have highlighted how the AD benefits provided the impetus for investment in the high-capital-cost \nwind energy sector, and withdrawal of the benefit correlates with a fall in capacity additions (IISD, 2015).", "start_char_idx": 23449, "end_char_idx": 26280, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7094734d-3003-4feb-91dd-5fbc9301e1f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7094734d-3003-4feb-91dd-5fbc9301e1f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "\"India's Roadmap to 2030 Decarbonization: Challenges, Pathways, and Policy Innovations in Renewable Energy Growth and Storage Technologies\"", "prev_section_summary": "Summary:\nThe section discusses the growth of the wind energy sector in India, focusing on the decline in wind power tariffs from 2011 to 2022, as depicted in Figure 4.

This scheme was introduced to facilitate \nthe entry of large independent power producers, including foreign direct investors to the wind power sector.

The DISCOM took the electricity generated by a captive wind farm of an industrial enterprise located \nwhere there was wind power potential and banked it. This banking was notional. The industrial enterprise was billed on \na net basis after deducting from its electricity consumption the quantum of wind power it had banked. The industrial \nenterprise located elsewhere took electricity from the DISCOM to meet its actual electricity needs. The banking \nmechanism proved to be an attractive option for industrial consumers. The DISCOM tariff for industrial consumers \nranged between `7\u20139/kWh. The banking provisions allowed them to avail electricity at a cost of `4\u20135/kWh from their \ncaptive wind farm leading to significant savings.  9\n2.2  National Solar Mission \nThe Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) was launched in 2010. The target was to achieve solar power \ncapacity of 20 GW by 2022. The Government of India in June 2015 revised the target of installation of renewable energy \ncapacity to 175 GW till 2022, comprising 100 GW solar capacity, including 40 GW of rooftop solar systems. The National \nSolar Mission adopted the process of inviting tariff-based bids for grid-connected solar power projects. A series of bids \nwere invited, and projects were awarded to a few bidders in each round to create a new competitive industry structure \nof solar power developers.

Solar tariffs declined rapidly from `6.48/\nkWh in March 2013 to `1.99/kWh in December 2020 in response to the competitive bid process. Figure 6 depicts \nthe decreasing trend of solar tariffs in India from 2010 to 2022.

The financial health \nof DISCOMS has steadily deteriorated, with total accumulated losses doubling between the fiscal years 2013 and 2020, \ndespite bailouts (PFC, 2021). This needs to be set right at the earliest. The Ministry of Power (MoP) has again initiated a \nfresh set of strong measures to improve the situation.  These must yield results and be seen as succeeding in the next \ntwo years. Private investments in renewables use finance from the domestic as well as global markets. The sanctity of \nPPAs and record of timely payments for existing renewable energy projects has facilitated the financing of new projects \nso far. The implicit state guarantee behind SECI and DISCOMs has helped in reducing risk perceptions in financing RE \nprojects. But markets are fragile. The moment they lose faith, there would be a loss of willingness to finance new \nrenewable energy projects in India. If this happens, the 2030 targets would become unachievable. \n2. Land \nAvailability of adequate land is clearly essential for the accelerated development of renewable power projects to \nachieve the 2030 targets. For such scaling up, land needs would rise proportionately and so would the challenges \nrelated to land assembly. These would need to be addressed. Grid-connected wind and solar projects, for example, \nrequire land in excess of 2 hectares per MW (Thapar S, et al ., 2017). States have been facilitating land assembly for \nthe development of solar power projects. Private developers have developed the ability to assemble land efficiently \nfor their projects. The Government of India is in addition implementing a scheme for setting up of 52 Solar Parks of \naggregate capacity 38 GW in 14 states. Solar power projects of an aggregate capacity of around 9.2 GW have already \nbeen commissioned in these parks.9 More such solar parks would need to be set up in the coming years. Work for \nthese may be initiated now. \nTo the extent captive solar plants are set up by industries and institutions, and the decentralized rural kW range projects \nwith a feed-in tariff gain momentum, the need of land for large projects would get reduced. Further, the beginning \nthat has been made in putting up  of solar panels on canals needs to be taken forward with speed.  All canals could be \ncovered with solar panels by 2030. This has immense potential, and a minimum of 10 GW capacity could be created on \nmajor canal systems of India.10 3. SOLAR AND WIND POWER DEVELOPMENT\n9   PIB (2022).

Details available at https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/2021/03/09/installing-solar-atop-canals/16\n3. Demand \nIn the last few years, in some states there was a view that they had already signed PPAs for power in excess of their \nneed and they, therefore, do not need to enter into fresh PPAs. The phrase \u2018surplus power\u2019 in terms of generation \ncapacity gained currency. The overall PLF of thermal power stations in the country came down to less than 60% from \na high of over 75%. As the growth rate of the economy moderated, actual demand growth of electricity became lower \nthan projected by the CEA. Further, when demand is fully met and there are no power cuts, the PLF of thermal power \nstations have to be lower if there are no separate peaking power supply arrangements as the demand curve is not flat. \nA natural question is whether demand in 2030 would be large enough for the capacity being envisaged. Demand \nprojections are inherently uncertain. A number of studies have made projections of installed capacities by 2030 \n(Annexure-I) and how power stations would be able to meet demand by 2030. It can, however, be said that demand \ngrowth in the coming years would be higher due to two trends, which are gaining momentum. The first is growing \ndemand for air conditioning and electrical appliances with rising middle class incomes. The second is the breakthrough \nthat may be occurring in the demand of EVs. These would be gaining a substantial market share in the coming years. \nPromotion of induction cooking could be another end-use, which could boost the demand for the electricity.\n3.1  Decentralized Solar Power\nThe growth of solar power in India has a distortion as the bulk of the capacity creation is taking place through large grid \nconnected solar power projects. Decentralized solar power generation through rooftops is cheaper. No investments in \ntransmission are required. There are no transmission losses. While efforts have been made in recent years to promote \nsolar rooftop power, the results are still modest. Decentralized rooftop solar capacity in India is only 7.6 GW (as on \nMarch 31, 2022) against the target of 40 GW. A breakthrough in getting momentum in deployment of decentralized \nsolar power in the kW range is overdue. Such a breakthrough would make it that much easier to attain 2030 targets.\nMany states provide subsidized or free electricity for pumping up groundwater for irrigation to get higher yields in \nagriculture. In 2019, agricultural demand made up 18% of India\u2019s electricity consumption. The use of solar power \nfor pumping water for irrigation in agriculture is economical. If the solar panels are located at the pump, then there \nare no transmission and distributions costs. Solar power when the sun shines is the cheapest source of electricity. \nThe resulting agriculture demand shift to the hours of solar power generation facilitates absorption of variable RE \ngeneration at lower costs. It has enabled several states to accommodate high levels of solar and wind power without \nmajor system events (IEA, 2021). \nPM-KUSUM Scheme\nThe Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme is an ambitious scheme \ndesigned to support installation of solar pumps for irrigation. The scheme provides assistance to farmers to set up \nstandalone solar pumps, and to solarize their grid-connected pumps. Solar energy projects of capacity 500 kW to  \n2 MW can be installed under the scheme by farmers, group of farmers, cooperatives, panchayats, and farmer producer \norganizations. Farmers can install the project on their land and earn by selling power to DISCOM or provide their land \non lease to a developer and get lease fee. With solarized grid-connected agriculture pumps, power generated can \nbe used to meet the irrigation needs of the farmer and the excess solar power can be sold to DISCOMs and generate \nextra income.17\nStates have been designing their own implementation strategies.11 In Haryana, the State Government is bearing \nthe cost of solarization, besides the Government of India subsidy, and the farmer will get `1/kWh for sale of \nsurplus power. In Gujarat, settlement is done on net-metering basis and farmer can feed and draw power from \nthe grid.", "start_char_idx": 41885, "end_char_idx": 46283, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef07953e-a118-4fa6-837c-1a8b87ba3388": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef07953e-a118-4fa6-837c-1a8b87ba3388", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "\"India's Roadmap to 2030 Decarbonization: Challenges, Pathways, and Policy Innovations in Renewable Energy Growth and Storage Technologies\"", "prev_section_summary": "### Summary:\n\nThe section from the document titled \"India's Roadmap to 2030 Decarbonization: Challenges, Pathways, and Policy Innovations in Renewable Energy Growth and Storage Technologies\" covers several key topics and entities related to the development of solar and wind power in India.\n\n#### Key Topics:\n1. **Demand for Electricity**:\n   -

IEA\u2019s Gujarat State Model has predicted that flexibility from agricultural demand response in Gujarat is \ncentral to the cost-effective integration of increased solar generation by 2030. The Rajasthan Renewable Energy \nCorporation allotted 722 MW plants to 623 farmers under the KUSUM scheme, which ensure energy security \nfor farmers, as they could generate revenue from their agriculturally unproductive or barren land (Hindu, 2022). \nSimilarly, Chhattisgarh State Electricity Regulatory Commission (CSERC) has proposed a generic levelized tariff of  \n`3.51/kwh for decentralized solar projects with 500 kW to 2 MW capacity. Madhya Pradesh has determined a pre-fixed \nlevelized tariff of `3.07/kwh, applicable for projects under PM-KUSUM scheme (Mercom India, 2022).\nAs of April 2022, under the KUSUM scheme, 42.75 MW of solar capacity, 97,463 off-grid and standalone solar-powered \nirrigation pumps and 1026 individual pump solar pumps have been installed. It is estimated that full implementation \nof the KUSUM scheme will lead to reduction in CO2 emissions by 32 million tonnes annually by replacing 8 million \ndiesel irrigation pumps with solar-powered pumps.12 \nFeed-in-tariff \nThe KUSUM scheme concept can be taken to the next level by introducing a straightforward feed-in tariff system. \nThe feed-in-tariff was used successfully in Germany. Such a feed-in tariff mechanism for decentralized solar power \ngeneration in the kW range is a very attractive option for all. For DISCOMs, the average cost of supply ranges between \n`7 and `8/kWh and has been increasing at an approximate average rate of 6% per year (Prayas Energy Group, 2018). \nThey lose around `4\u20135 for every unit of electricity supplied to lower income households (Shankar and Avni, 2020). \nFor the feed-in-tariff to succeed, it must be attractive for private investment. It needs to be well above the price bids \nreceived for large solar projects. This is necessary as there would be higher unit costs in dispersed small installations \nas well as greater risks. A feed-in tariff between `3 and `4 would trigger large-scale private investment and at the \nsame time save money for the DISCOMs. The DISCOM, with the approval of SERC, would announce the feed-in tariff for \nprocurement of power in the kW range. The injection points could be indicated where power would be taken on a first-\ncome, first-served basis subject to the technical capacity at that point. The per unit cost savings for DISCOMs would \nimprove their financial health. Additionally, DISCOMs would not have to make substantial investments in transmission \ninfrastructure to absorb solar power unlike in the case of large solar projects. A feed-in tariff would create an attractive \nlarge market with minimal transaction costs and risks.\nIndia has approximately 6 lakh villages. Assuming a potential of 1 MW per village, India has a potential of 600 GW. \nA variety of business models would emerge and compete for this market space. These would range from farmers \ninvesting in the solar panels on their own to just leasing space for the panels. Farmers\u2019 incomes would rise across the \ncountry. Dispersed job creation for installation would take place. Finances would flow through banks and NBFCs. These \nin turn could access cheaper global green finance. \nFurther, the expansion of solar power generation in rural areas would enable DISCOMs to supply reliable electricity for \nagricultural and other productive activities during the daytime and that too at a lower cost. Getting electricity in the \nday for irrigation would enable farmers to use water more efficiently and conserve water. This in turn would increase \nproductivity and incomes in rural areas. \n11  Details available at http://164.100.47.193/lsscommittee/Energy/17_Energy_17.pdf\n12  Details available at https://mnre.gov.in/img/documents/uploads/file_f-1632204688401.pdf18\n3.2  Accelerating Momentum of Wind Capacity \nThe Global Wind Energy Council estimates that the Indian wind sector is expected to add 20.2 GW of wind power \ncapacity between 2020 and 2025.

These have comparatively low-capacity utilization \nof 10\u201315%, compared to more than 30% capacity utilization of modern wind turbines (Kumar, et al., 2022). If these \nturbines are repowered, the project capacity may be increased by 2\u20133 times, resulting in a significant increase in \nannual energy output. Some of the best wind resource sites have <1 MW of turbines, which have a hub height of less \nthan 80 metres. With the development of technologies and innovation, 3.6\u20134 MW turbines are now installed in India \nwith a hub height of 100 metres. \nA pragmatic and viable policy framework for repowering older wind projects at high-resource sites needs to be put \nin place after stakeholder consultations. This would accelerate India\u2019s wind energy development.  There is a potential \nof 4.5 GW for repowering old sites (GWEC, 2021). To accelerate the wind power development further, reintroducing \nbanking would certainly help. It did deliver very good results earlier. Firms would on their own find good sites and \nput up state-of-the-art wind turbines. With banking they would save money on their electricity bills. At the same time \nthey would be part of the vanguard in decarbonization. DISCOMS are in case providing net metering for RE. This is \nan extension of the concept as captive generation in wind farms is taking place elsewhere rather than in premises of \nthe C&I consumer. Further, wind power is generated at night also and so needs less storage. Hence, banking for wind \npower may be introduced through DISCOMS from the central government.   \n3.3  Start Off-shore Wind Development\nAccording to forecasts, global off-shore wind capacity would exceed 2000 GW by 2050 with the Indian region expected \nto have 140 GW of this installed capacity (MNRE, 2017). According to the National Institute for Wind Energy, total off-\nshore wind energy potential is 302 GW at 100 metres\u00a0and 695.50 GW at 120 metres\u00a0hub height. Approximately 36 GW \nof off-shore wind potential exists off the coast in Gujarat and nearly 35 GW exists off the Tamil Nadu coast.\nHowever, there are significant challenges to the deployment of off-shore wind farms. These include subsea cabling, \nturbine foundation, installation of turbines including logistics, and development of transmission connectivity to the \nstate/national grid (National Offshore Wind Energy Policy).13 The per mega-watt costs of offshore wind turbines are \nat least 2\u20133 times higher than onshore wind turbines, according to the MNRE. However, the price of offshore wind \nturbines and tariffs are expected to decline as the country begins and increases deployment.14 As in other sectors, \nwith volumes and competition, costs should decline. Further, with the provision of long-term debt, the tariff from such \nfarms could become lower. \nThis is the right time to initiate the development of offshore wind in the country. For offshore wind, suitable wind \nfarm sites need to be identified and a few promising ones may be taken up for development. Tariff bids may be invited \nsuccessively providing wind data and other site details to discover the tariff. The transmission system for evacuation \nfrom the off-shore wind farm to the grid would have to be separately developed and provided to synchronize with the \ncommissioning of the offshore wind farm. With price discovery through successive rounds of bidding and development \nin the next 4\u20135 years, it would be easier to take a call on the pace at which to scale up offshore wind power development.\n13  Details available at https://mnre.gov.in/img/documents/uploads/3debfe9158b643d8a3e06a7a007f2ef9.pdf\n14  Details available at http://164.100.47.193/lsscommittee/Energy/17_Energy_17.pdf19\n4.1 System Studies \nDetailed system studies including steady-state, transient and dynamic stability studies need to carried out be on a \ncontinuing basis to appropriately assess power system security and stability with high share of VRE in the generation \nmix.

DISCOMs will have \nto assume greater responsibility for demand and its profile, system studies, flexibility and ancillary services. SERCs may \nconsider mandating the same in regulations. \n4.2 Demand Side Management \nDemand Side Management (DSM) has been an effective way of optimizing capacity utilization and minimizing the \nneed for additional investments. The load profiles are becoming increasingly variable, with sharper morning and \nevening peaks. This trend will increase in the coming years. On the supply side, the growth of variable renewables \nwill enhance intermittency in generation. Load shifting and peak shaving are some of the more cost-effective DSM \nmeasures. DSM reduces the operational costs of systems and improves reliability. The implementation of DSM in \nIndia faces challenges, which include a lack of adequate understanding and an appropriate regulatory environment. \nDSM can be implemented through direct measures like rostering of supply to industrial consumers or by supplying \nelectricity for irrigation to farmers only in the late night and early morning.  The better option is through the use of \nprice signals, time of use tariff with a large difference between peak and off-peak pricing. Successful DSM would be a \nwin-win situation for utilities, governments, regulators, and consumers. \nEnergy efficiency is the low hanging fruit for moderating growth in demand. At the same time, it increases consumer \nsatisfaction with lower life cycle costs. Programmes for the promotion of energy efficiency have been remarkably \nsuccessful in India. Not only is it on track to achieve its Paris commitments, but it should be able to achieve its enhanced \n2030 goals. It is important to note that energy conservation practices and promotion of the use of energy-efficient \nappliances also moderate the rise in the peaks of the demand curve. Programmes such as star labelling of appliances, \ntransition to the use of LED lamps, the National Street Lighting Programme, and promotion of energy-efficient \nagricultural pump sets are transformative. These assist in peak load management by improving energy efficiency and \nreducing overall demand (NBR, 2021). \nThe difference between peak and off-peak electricity demand would, however, continue to increase with rising per \ncapita incomes and the absence of power cuts. Demand surges would occur with greater frequency with increasing \nclimate change episodes. The change in demand patterns require better transmission planning, innovative solutions \nfor grid stability, creation of reserves, ancillary services, and markets. This in turn would need appropriate coordinated \npolicies from the central and state governments, and new regulatory mechanisms from the Central and State Electricity \nRegulatory Commissions.  Forecasting, scheduling and imbalance handling would assume increasing importance in \nthe coming years.\n4.3  Time-of-use Tariffs\nDynamic matching of supply and demand through the introduction of time-of-use (TOU) pricing of retail electricity \nsupply can incentivize consumers to adapt consumption patterns through appropriate price signals. More complex \nagreements for voluntary demand reduction or curtailment, peak demand limiters, or automated control systems can 4. SYSTEM STUDIES, DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT , TOU/  \n GREEN TARIFFS20\nfurther contribute to peak load management. Several international examples implemented in California, Denmark \nand the UK show how tariffs can be better aligned with solar generation and peak demand by implementing TOU \ntariff. This model can also be implemented in Indian states, which would help reduce the cost to DISCOMs of meeting \npeak demand. Regular updates and revision of TOU timeslots would incentivize rooftop solar additions and demand \nresponse to reshape the load curves (IEA, 2021).\nCurrently, TOU tariffs are implemented by most states in India and are applicable to large  consumers. The surcharge \nfor consumption in peak hours varies from 10% to 20% compared to rebates/concessions that vary from 15% to 25% \nin off-peak hours. This has not led to a significant shift in consumers\u2019 response.15 The price differential has to be much \nlarger.

Flattening peak demand with the right \nprice signal would reduce overall capital costs needed to maintain reliable quality supply.\nFurther, with price discovery of peaking power through competitive bidding, it may well turn out that storage projects \nbecome commercially viable and even attractive. If they do, then they are needed for using normal electricity from \nthe grid for storage during off peak hours and for later use to meet peaking power needs. Later, as RE capacities grow, \nthey can be used to store RE power during the day and supply green electricity at night. Early deployment of flexible \noptions and storage technologies would also aid in increasing supply during the peak hours from storage to fully cater \nto peak demand instead of creating new thermal capacity for this purpose. There is, therefore, a strong case for early \ndeployment of storage, which would become cheaper and affordable with economies of scale.   \n4.4  Green Tariffs \nThe concept of green tariffs has evolved as a popular option for companies to procure renewables. These are \nspecialized retail tariffs that are offered by DISCOMs to sell renewable energy to their consumers. The time is right for \nthe introduction of green tariffs in India. \nA good beginning has been made. The Ministry of Power (MoP) has announced Electricity (Promoting Renewable \nEnergy Through Green Energy Open Access) Rules, 2022. These rules are forward looking. These rules are notified \nfor promoting generation, purchase and consumption of green energy including the energy from waste-to-energy \nplants. These rules allow consumers with a sanctioned load of 100 kW or above to purchase electricity directly from \nthe renewable power producers through open access (DISCOMs).\u00a0These rules would enable the consumers to use fossil \nfuel free renewable energy to become green and carbon neutral. The provisions in these rules have the potential to \nbring a paradigm shift in India\u2019s private renewable energy procurement while benefiting Commercial and Industrial \n(C&I) sector and MSME consumers. Commercial and industrial consumers are allowed to purchase green power and \nallows captive consumers to take power with no minimum limitation. They give individual consumers the choice to use \nonly carbon free electricity through open access. \nThe next step would be for DISCOMS to offer to consumers the choice of using only carbon free green electricity from a \nprospective date on a net basis to begin with. Then from a later date consumers may be given the choice to buy carbon \nfree electricity on a real time basis. The DISCOMS would have to buy renewables with storage to be able to discharge \nthis obligation on a real time basis. The State Electricity Regulatory Commissions would need to authorize and \napprove these separately. Giving individual consumer the choice to buy green electricity even if it is more expensive \nwill empower them to contribute individually to the electricity transition to zero and help save mankind from the \nimpending disaster of global warming. \n15  CEA(2019). Details available at https://cea.nic.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tariff_2019.pdf21\nThere are grid integration challenges with increase in the share of renewables. The primary challenge is of ensuring \nquality supply on a real time basis \u2013 minute by minute, second by second \u2013 with a rising share of variable solar and \nwind generation, which is intermittent and depends on weather conditions. The power system would need to have \nincreasing flexibility. The achievement of the target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity involves a fundamental \ntransformation of the all India integrated electricity grid system. Electricity demand would have to be met fully when \nthe sun does not shine, and the wind does not blow. The capacity to ramp up supply from other sources instantaneously \nto meet demand, to maintain grid stability and provide reliable power supply to all consumers would become more \nchallenging. \nTo begin with, greater flexibility from thermal plants is needed.

The CERC has modified regulations for thermal plants to \nhave the flexibility of moving down to 55% of rated capacity and ramping. In April 2022, the MoP announced a revised \nscheme to replace 58,000 million unit (MU) of thermal power with renewables, which is equivalent to RE capacity \nof 30,000 MW.16 The thermal power will be gradually replaced with renewables in a phased manner up to 2025\u201326  \n( i.e., 20% in 2023\u201324, 35% in 2024\u201325 and 45% in 2025\u201326). A snapshot of year-wise trajectory of replacement of \nthermal power with renewable power is detailed in Annexure-I.\nAs the share of renewables rises, generation for some duration would become higher than demand, then storage of \nexcess RE would be necessary to prevent losing electricity, which has zero marginal cost. Further, if the use of thermal \npower between sunset and sunrise has to be reduced then storage of electricity would be the way forward as solar \npower would have the larger share in RE. For meeting peak demand, storage may become the better option.  The CERC \nhas recognized that storage would play a key role in improving the operating capabilities of the grid, lower power \npurchase cost, address the variability and intermittency of renewables and also cater to peak demand. The large-scale \nintegration of RE with an increasing share of solar power, can only be achieved by increasing deployment of grid-scale \nenergy storage.  This would absorb variable renewable energy from the grid when generation is in excess of demand \nand supply electricity to the grid when demand exceeds generation. CEA estimates the optimal capacity mix by 2029\u2013\n2030 to include 27,000 MW/108,000 MWh of grid-scale storage (CEA, 2020). \nIn March 2022, the MoP issued guidelines for procurement and utilization of battery energy storage systems (BESS) \nalong with ancillary services. The comprehensive guidelines are for procurement of energy from BESS by the \n\u2018Procurers\u2019 , through competitive bidding, from grid-connected projects to be set up on \u201cBuild-Own-Operate\u201d or \u201cBuild-\nOwn-Operate-Transfer\u201d basis, for intra-state and inter-state projects. The Ministry has also introduced the scheme for \nbundling of thermal and hydropower stations with standalone renewables and renewables coupled with storage.17  \nThere would be a requirement of nurturing new market structures and evolving appropriate regulations. As the share \nof renewables rises especially with solar power being the main driver for achieving the 2030 target, storage becomes \nessential. For India, this need would come much earlier than in those countries where wind power is the main driver of \nthe decarbonization of electricity. Wind power is generated during the day as well as during the night as wind blows \nround the clock. On the other hand, solar power is generated only during the day when the sun shines. \n16 Ministry of Power(2022).

The Department \nof Energy (DoE), US is currently funding research to explore the potential pathways of heat transfer mediums and \nreach the goal of reducing the cost to 5 cents per kWh through innovative solutions (Young, C., 2022). Solar towers \nusing molten salt as a high temperature heat transfer fluid and storage medium (or other high temperature medium) \nappear to be the most promising CSP technology. This is based on their low energy storage costs, the high-capacity \nfactor achievable, greater efficiency of the steam cycle, and their firm output capability. An additional advantage is \nthat in areas with excellent solar resources, low cost solar PV can naturally be paired with CSP to allow round-the-\nclock generation. The confluence of extremely low-cost solar PV, onshore and even offshore wind combined with the \ninstallation of CSP could decarbonize power systems rapidly. Globally, CSP plants are concentrated in Spain (2.3 GW), \nthe United States (1.6 GW), Morocco (0.5 GW), China (0.5 GW), and South Africa (0.5 GW). The Middle East and North \nAfrica MENA region is at the forefront. Recently, the lowest PPA for a CSP project was granted in Dubai (United Arab \nEmirates) at $0.073/kWh for the DEWA 950 MW CSP-PV hybrid project.\n22  Details available at https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/115/02/0222.pdf25\nDeveloping pilot projects at sites and bidding for solar thermal plants with storage should begin now. This would lead \nto price discovery. Successive projects of competitive bidding would give a sense of the potential movement down the \ncost curve. With cost reduction from volumes, competition among developers and domestic manufacturing, CSP may \nbecome a very attractive cost-effective way of achieving large-scale grid storage that India would need as it moves to \nachieve its 2030 goals and then on to net zero.\n5.3  Battery Energy Storage Technologies\nBattery energy storage technologies are gaining popularity globally for grid level applications due to rapidly reducing \ncosts of installations along with technological advancements. It has features like quick response time, distributed \nenergy/power- balancing capabilities, and phased installation, which make them eminently suitable for handling \nthe reliability and intermittency of RE generation (TERI, 2021). India has initiated efforts for the deployment of grid-\nscale battery storage on scale through the recent SECI tenders. BESS may emerge as one of the preferred options for \nflexibility and ensuring grid stability. According to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global share \nof India in battery deployment would be 35% by 2040 as depicted in Figure 10.\nThe most commonly used battery chemistries for grid-level applications in the current scenario are based on lead, \nsodium, nickel, transition metals (vanadium, chromium, and iron), and lithium electrochemistry. There are many \ntechnologies which are at demonstration level. Figure 13 provides an overview of various grid-scale technologies. \nSome of these technologies like molten rocks, flywheel, super capacitors, green hydrogen are in the nascent stages of \ndevelopment or are still not able to find deployment at the scales, which make them cost effective.\nIRENA estimates that by 2030 the total installed cost of flow batteries, still very much in development, could drop \nby two-thirds; high-temperature batteries by 56\u201360%; flywheels by 35%; and compressed air energy storage by 17% \n(IRENA, 2019).

Green hydrogen, rather than fossil fuel-\nbased hydrogen production, is the way forward for complete decarbonization. The cost of green hydrogen is declining \ndue to the falling price of RE. The focus is now on reducing the cost of electrolysers, which is the major component in \nthe green hydrogen value chain. Policy and regulatory support to foster production of green hydrogen is being put \nin place under the National Hydrogen Mission. Further, the use of hydrogen in pilot hydrogen energy projects for (a) \nremote locations as a substitute for diesel generation and (b) for seasonal peak needs may be taken up. \nLarge-scale hydrogen-based storage presents a strong case to balance long-term intermittency in electricity generation \nfrom wind and solar power, especially in relation to inter-seasonal shifts (Stafell I., et al ., 2019). According to TERI\u2019s recent \nanalysis, the cost of alkaline electrolysers is projected to drop 56% from around `6.3 crore/MW (USD 0.86 million/MW) \ntoday to around `2.8 crore/MW (USD 0.38 million/MW) by 2030. Hydrogen energy storage technologies would play a \nkey role when India transitions to a full-scale decarbonization pathway beyond 2030.

So far, the Indian programme in solar power has been highly \nimport dependent. However, in wind power, India has established a globally competitive manufacturing industry. The \ntotal domestic manufacturing capacities of solar power equipment within the country are quite modest. Against an \nannual demand of 20 GW and more in the coming years, domestic manufacturing capacity is 3 GW for solar cells and \n~9\u201310 GW for the modules. There is an import dependence to the tune of 80% or more.23\nIn 2021, the MNRE began implementing Production Linked Scheme (PLI) in the National Programme on High Efficiency \nSolar PV Modules. The Scheme aims to promote domestic manufacturing of high efficiency solar PV modules with an \noutlay of `4500 crore.24 The PLI Scheme is now providing support for high efficiency solar PV modules and advanced \nchemistry cells. A TERI study has estimated domestic demand for solar equipment would be able to generate a value \nof `294,000 crore (USD 42 billion) by 2030 through import substitution (Shankar and Avni, 2020). \nDomestic manufacturing could be promoted in Special Economic Zones and Special Manufacturing Hubs with high \nquality infrastructure of power, water, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management. Domestic manufacturing \ncould be rapidly scaled up by inviting successive government procurement bids for solar panels with full value addition \nin India. The tender should offer land in the manufacturing hub with cheaper direct electricity supply and quality \ninfrastructure. The project bid should be for offtake of, say 1 GW annually for 5 years from the date of the successful L1 \nbidder commencing production. If L2, L3 match the L1 price, they could get orders for the same, or 75%, of the volume \nof L1. Bids should be accepted even if the L1 price is a bit higher than that of imported panels. With successive bids \nprices would decline. Duty-free imports of machinery and spares should be allowed  to enable cost competitiveness. \nThis dispensation should enable India to have a globally competitive solar industry in five years.  This approach can be \nreplicated for storage technologies from the outset. \nThe PLI scheme is now providing support for solar modules and advanced chemistry battery cells. It should be extended \nto cover the full value chain of solar panels, reversible turbines for pump storage, and mirrors for solar thermal plants \nand green hydrogen.

The increase in solar and wind power \ncapacities have been extraordinary. This growth of renewables has come from government initiatives and private \nsector investments. The public policies have provided risk mitigation and promoted the emergence of a competitive \nindustry structure.\nDespite the impressive momentum of renewables, India due to its sheer size, is the second-largest consumer of \ncoal globally. Approximately 70% of the country\u2019s electricity was generated by coal in 2021. The highly ambitious \nannouncements at COP26 of decarbonizing energy to 50% and creating 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity would \nbring about a qualitative transformation and create a new paradigm of energy development and pave the way for full \ndecarbonization of India\u2019s electricity system.  \nAchieving 2030 goals though challenging is feasible. A rapid acceleration of the pace of new solar and wind power \ncapacity creation has to take place primarily with private investment. Improving the financial health of DISCOMs at \nthe earliest is essential. Markets, domestic as well as international, must not see the risk of delayed payments to RE \ngenerators as being real and growing. The central government needs to give this the highest priority and ensure \ntimely payments to maintain market confidence and flow of the higher levels of capital needed for investments for \nthe attainment of the 2030 targets. \nThe following are the key to the achievement of India\u2019s 2030 targets announced at COP26:\nFirstly, renewable energy expansion has been taking place primarily through large grid-scale projects. The unlocking of \nthe potential of decentralized renewable energy generation needs focus and appropriate policies. This paper presents \na case for implementation of feed-in-tariff in the kW range for solar generation in India. This would bring benefits to \nDISCOMs, increase in farmer incomes, create jobs and improve the quality of power supply in rural areas.\nSecondly, bidding for utility scale wind and solar power projects would need to be scaled up substantially.  In addition, \noffshore wind power development should be initiated.\nThirdly, solar and wind power generation is variable, intermittent and depends on weather conditions. The integration \nof solar and wind requires an adequate amount of flexibility in power system. Flexibility would be a key necessity. \nThis would require an ongoing process of power system studies including transient and dynamic stability studies and \ntransmission planning. From these, the requirement of ancillary services, transmission, and storage will emerge. \nFourthly, India should initiate storage projects using mature technologies for pumped storage plants (PSP), concentrated \nsolar thermal plants (CSP), and batteries. The state would need to take leadership for the development of pumped \nstorage plants after identification of sites in order of priority. With price discovery, and a more realistic assessment of \npotential of cost reductions, decisions on scaling up in the later part of this decade would become easier. \nFifthly, India should try to become a cost effective and competitive manufacturing hub of RE. The PLI scheme should \nbe extended to cover the full spectrum of renewable energy equipment production, solar panels, mirrors and sensors \nfor solar thermal, batteries for grid use, and hydrogen. In addition, public procurement from a prospective date should \nbe used to achieve full value addition in RE manufacturing. 7. WAY FORWARD 30\nSixthly, in addition to the Ministry of Power\u2019s recent guidelines for green energy open access rules, the DISCOMs need \nto take the next step and give Commercial and Industrial (C&I) consumers the choice to buy carbon free electricity on \na real time basis with separate tariffs. This choice may then be extended to all consumers. This would give consumers \nthe ability to accelerate the transition to carbon free electricity by paying more initially.

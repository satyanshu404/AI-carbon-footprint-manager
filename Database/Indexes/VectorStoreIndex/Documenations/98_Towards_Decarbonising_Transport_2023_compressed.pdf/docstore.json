Since 2018, nations around the world have significantly ramped up their commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the COP26 in 2021, over 100 national governments, states, cities and major corporations signed the Glasgow Declaration, which pledges to accelerate the transition to 100% zero-emission  \ncars and vans. The number of countries with net-  \nzero pledges and transport-related NDC targets is  \nrising.\nThese are welcome developments. However, the domi -\nnant role played by fossil fuels remains unchanged, and transport emissions continue to rise worldwide. In addition, recent international conferences have failed to strengthen the political momentum for transforma -\ntion. The COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh in November 2022 ended without agreements on further emissions reduc -\ntions, much less a commitment to the phasing out of fossil fuels. The G20 Bali summit did not address trans -\nport matters at all. New initiatives are thus needed to bring transport to the forefront of governmental action on climate change. \nTo be sure, the journey to a decarbonised transport sector will be far from easy, not least because the world community is already facing enormous chal -lenges. The Covid-19 pandemic is still a serious threat in various parts of the world. And the war in Ukraine has triggered a crisis marked by increased geo -\npolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, spiralling energy prices, and rising inflation. Apparently the need to address multiple crises simultaneously will  \nbe the rule rather than the exception in coming years. Of course, the future is notoriously difficult to predict, yet two things are abundantly clear: The climate crisis is intensifying and will become increasingly severe. Furthermore, given transport\u2019s status as the sector with the second largest emissions, the decarbonisa -\ntion of transport is essential to avert the worst effects of climate change.\nG20 countries can and should take the lead in moving towards a climate-neutral transport sector. G20 coun -\ntries are responsible for the lion\u2019s share of global trans-port emissions. Furthermore, they are also in the best position to encourage change, given their political and economic influence. At this crucial moment in time, three emerging economies assume the G20 presi -\ndency: Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024. We hope these presidencies will usher in a transformative perspective for the global community, one that devotes due attention to the transport sector. India\u2019s motto for the current presidency \u2013 \u201cOne Earth, One Family, One Future\u201d \u2013 certainly gives cause for optimism. In this report, NDC Transport Initiative for Asia  provides insights into the sector ambitions of G20 countries to date. Funded by the International Climate Initiative (IKI), the initiative is a joint program of seven organisations: Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internation -\nale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Agora Verkehrswende, the SLOCAT Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport, the International Council on Clean Trans-portation (ICCT), the International Transport Forum (ITF), the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Cen -\ntury (REN21).", "start_char_idx": 3470, "end_char_idx": 8252, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df7a394e-b86f-46d3-b6ea-aa93e4078516": {"__data__": {"id_": "df7a394e-b86f-46d3-b6ea-aa93e4078516", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "Title: \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\"", "prev_section_summary": "Summary:\nThe excerpt from the document titled \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\" discusses the critical role of the transport sector in economic development and its significant contribution to global emissions.

\nTARGETS IN TRANSPORT1301 | Current national and international targets in transport\nIn 2021 the global community entered a new phase of \nclimate ambition by devoting increasing attention to the decarbonisation of the transport sector. COP26 in Glasgow resulted in an unprecedented number of net-zero pledges, strategic declarations, commitments, and initiatives related to transport. First and foremost was the Declaration on Accelerating the Transition to 100% zero-emission cars and vans. Its signatories, industri -\nalised and emerging economies alike, committed themselves to achieving the zero-emission target by 2035\u20132040. The willingness of countries to set more ambitious targets like these and take increased inter -\nest in transport decarbonisation show how much the discourse has intensified since 2018. \nAlongside new international agreements came activist \ncampaigns such as Fridays for Future, climate strikes, the occupation of mining sites, and other international protests. All the while, the world underwent political and environmental turmoil. The USA withdrew from the Paris Agreement and then rejoined under a new administration. There were record-breaking summer temperatures, unprecedented weather events, and severe drought. Geopolitical realities shifted and new international conflicts erupted. The COVID pandemic has not only killed millions but also underlined the connection between human economic activity and CO\u2082 emissions, which dropped as large parts of the globe went into lockdown. Moreover, it drove many off pub-lic transport and into personal cars, which rejuvenated debate about everyday mobility across the globe. Amid all these developments, one thing has remained unvarying: the reality of climate change and the urgent need for decarbonisation. \nAs the world\u2019s largest economies, G20 countries are \nuniquely suited to play a leading role in enabling and enforcing the decarbonisation of the transport sector. And it is a role they have to take seriously if we are to prevent the direst projections from becoming reality.\nMany countries around the globe set net-zero targets \nand some countries announced surprisingly ambitious policy actions.

Since 2021, a number of countries have updated their NDCs or have been in the progress of finalising their revisions.\nThe following contains an overview of current inter -\nnational climate ambitions with a focus on the trans-\nport sector and G20 countries. \nNDCs\nThe most important targets regarding climate mitiga-tion at the international level are the NDCs set by the Paris Agreement and submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the timeframe for developing the first round of NDCs was short (2014\u20132015), it impelled many coun -\ntries to start assessing mitigation options and seek a national consensus on future development. In other words, despite its ambition shortfalls, the process has been extremely valuable. The second round of NDC submissions finished at the end of 2021. COP26 explicitly called for updating NDCs. This has been  followed up only by a minor number of countries until end of 2022. The third round begins in 2025.\nAll in all, 41% of second-generation NDCs contain \ntransport targets (either transport GHG mitigation tar -\ngets and / or non-GHG targets for transport), according \nto SLOCAT\u2019s latest report update \u201cClimate Strategies for Transport: An Analysis of Nationally Determined Con -\ntributions and Long-Term Strategies\u201d .\n1 Among G20 \ncountries, Japan was the only country to set quantita-tive GHG emissions target for the transport sector (46% below 2013 levels by 2030). In Europe, the EU sets emission targets for road transport that all EU member states have to follow: by 2030 emissions per kilometre for new road vehicles must be reduced between 31% (vans) and 37.5% (passenger cars) from 2021 levels. In the case of new large lorries, CO\u2082 emissions per kilo-metre have to be reduced on average by 30% from 2019\u20132020 levels. These targets may be extended to smaller lorries, buses, coaches, and trailers. Further -\nmore, the EU included the aviation sector in its ETS system. \nTwo other countries besides the EU have set specific targets regarding road vehicle emissions. Canada established a requirement of 100% zero-emission \n1 SLOCAT 2022aAgora Verkehrswende | Towards Decarbonising Transport 2023\n14Transport GHG reduction target\nNo G20 memberOther quantitative targets\nNo targetsQualitative targetsTransport related  \nNDC targets and  \nmeasures in the G20\nAgora Verkehrswende (2023) | Source: NDC and INDC submissions to the UNFCCC by 2022Study | 01 | Current national and international targets in transport\n15vehicle sales by 2035. China plans that by 2030 40% \nof all new vehicles will be powered by clean energy and the carbon emission intensity of railways will have fallen 10% relative to 2020 levels.\nThirteen of the G20 countries mention specific \ntransport-related measures. By contrast, USA,  Aus\ntralia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and post-Brexit UK \nhave not included any specific transport related measures in their NDCs.\nThough many countries in their first-round submis-\nsions stated few if any transport-related mitigation measures, the submissions in 2020\u20132021 included a notable variety which ranged from vehicle electrifica-tion strategies and the promotion of low-emission vehicles to the expansion of public transport. Many countries also intend to support the shift from road to rail in passenger and freight transport. The NDC sub-mitted by the USA also includes the promotion of charging infrastructure. China, which indicated one of the most extensive lists of measures, specifically named investment in walking and cycling infrastruc-ture. Several G20 members plan to promote vehicle energy efficiency through labelling (China and Argen -\ntina) and improved energy efficiency standards (China, USA, and Canada). Altogether, the new NDC climate strategies submit -\nted globally (not only in the G20) feature a strong focus on electrification of road transport across vehicle types: 52% of second-generation NDCs include e-mobility-related action, as the SLOCAT authors concluded in their report. \n2\nNet-zero pledges \nNet-zero pledges are usually laid down in the NDCs or in the Long-term Strategies (LTS).", "start_char_idx": 21353, "end_char_idx": 25702, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5936fa01-e6d4-4f03-ac65-79eeeac5e07d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5936fa01-e6d4-4f03-ac65-79eeeac5e07d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "Title: \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\"", "prev_section_summary": "Summary:\nThe section discusses the global efforts and policies aimed at decarbonizing the transport sector, with a particular focus on G20 countries.

In 2017, Sweden became the first country to enshrine a net-zero target in law, vowing to achieve climate neutrality by 2045. The UK followed in 2019 with a 2050 net-zero target. Meanwhile also Greece, Hungary, Iceland and Spain have net zero laws. As further G20 members Japan and South Korea passed a net zero law in 2021 and Australia in 2022. To date the number of countries pledging to become climate neutral has grown significantly. Most pledges were made in 2020 and 2021, many at the Climate Action Summit 2020 or the COP26 World Leaders Summit. In 2022 some of these political pledges were then reflected in the updated submissions of NDCs or LTS. \nWithin the G20, Mexico is the only country that has yet to submit net-zero targets. Among the other G20 countries, the majority plans to achieve economy-wide climate neutrality by 2050. Turkey\u2019s target is 2053. China and Saudi Arabia are aiming for 2060. India  envisages to be climate neutral by 2070. In Germany a landmark court ruling in 2021 found that the country\u2019s current climate law was in part unconstitutional \n2 SLOCAT 2022abecause it did not go far enough to ensure the funda-mental freedoms and rights of the next generations. In its revised climate law, Germany set a net-zero target for 2045. In 2022, Finland set the earliest legally bind -\ning net-zero target to which any country has ever com -\nmitted itself: 2035.\nA growing number of cities and companies are also \nmaking net-zero pledges. For example, Mumbai, a city with 15.4 million inhabitants and an area of 603 km\u00b2, plans to be climate neutral by 2050 and achieve emis-sions reductions of 30% by 2030 and of 44% by 2040 relative to 2019 levels. In the private sector many global players are revamping their production pro-cesses and analysing supply chains for ways to reduce emissions. Siemens, an economic heavy weight with a revenue of 63 billion USD (2021) and 215 000 employ -\nees around the globe, plans to be net-zero by 2030.\nAccording to Climate Watch\u2019s Net-Zero Tracker \n3, \n76\u00a0parties, representing 83 countries and 73.3% of \nglobal GHG emissions, have announced net-zero  targets so far.

Australia wants to reduce 50% of carbon emissions in the passenger road trans-port sector by 2030 relative to 2000 levels. Seven of the G20 countries have quantitative targets not related to GHG emissions. These targets include quantitative goals for fuel or final energy consumption and fuel efficiency. Australia plans to reduce fuel consumption by 30% in road transport by 2030. Japan intends to enhance fuel efficiency by approximately 13.4% for trucks and other heavy vehicles and by around 14.3% for buses by 2025 relative to 2015 fuel efficiency standards. South Korea aims to raise fuel efficiency for passenger vehicles to 35 km/l by 2035 and to 7.5 km/l for heavy-duty vehicles by 2040.\nA number of countries aspire a modal shift from road \nto rail, waterways, public transport, and bicycles.", "start_char_idx": 25310, "end_char_idx": 29457, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2ed400e-a725-4572-989d-4d1b7d607c65": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2ed400e-a725-4572-989d-4d1b7d607c65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "Title: \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\"", "prev_section_summary": "Summary:\nThe section from the document titled \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\" discusses various aspects of global and G20-specific climate strategies, focusing on net-zero pledges and national targets for the transport sector.

Their goals are expressed either as EV percentages in new sales and stock fleets or as absolute target numbers to be reached by a certain date. China planned to reach a 20% EV share in new sales by 2025, but achieved it early, with around 3\u00a0mil -\nlion new EVs sold in 2021. It expects that up to 7\u00a0million new EVs will be sold in 2022, and plans to reach a 40% share by 2030, though this is likely to happen sooner. Furthermore, China intends to electrify 100% of the public vehicle fleet by 2035. India has targeted a 30% EV share in passenger light-duty vehicle (LDV) sales by 2030. The EU intends to achieve a 15% share of BEVs and PHEVs by 2025 and a 35% share of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030. Among the G20 countries that have set absolute target numbers are Indonesia (2\u00a0million EVs and 13 million electric motorcycles by 2030) and Ger -\nmany (15 million fully electric passenger cars by 2030).Overview of national transport-related targets outside NDCs Table 1.1\nAgora Verkehrswende (2023) | Source: various (see annex)Country CO\u2082 targetsOther quantitative targetsEV  \ndeployment  \ntargetsICE  phase-out targetsEfficiency targetsTechnology targetsRenewables targetsModal share targets\nArgentina\nAustralia subsector\nBrazil\nCanada\nChina\nEU\nFrance\nGermany\nIndia\nIndonesia\nItaly\nJapan\nKorea, Rep \ufffd\nMexicoSaudi ArabiaSouth Africa\nTurkey\nUK\nUSA subsector\nexistingStudy | 01 | Current national and international targets in transport\n19Transport GHG reduction target\nNo G20 memberOther quantitative targets\nNo targetsQualitative targetsTransport related  \nnational targets  \nin the G20\nAgora Verkehrswende (2023) | Source: various (see annex)Agora Verkehrswende | Towards Decarbonising Transport 2023\n20To support the switch to EVs, eight countries and the \nEU set phase-out commitments for internal combus-tion engine (ICE) vehicles.", "start_char_idx": 29219, "end_char_idx": 32975, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c3db79d-6e31-449f-b595-006e6dc8577b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c3db79d-6e31-449f-b595-006e6dc8577b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "Title: \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\"", "prev_section_summary": "Summary:\nThe section from the document \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\" outlines various national targets and policies related to improving fuel efficiency, promoting modal shifts in transportation, and increasing the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) among G20 countries.

In 2022 at COP27, the declaration reached 214 signatories. The declara-tion includes the common goal of signatories to work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets. Among the G20 countries, the  declaration was signed by Canada, the UK, India, and Mexico and around 15 countries in the EU. In October 2022, the EU council of ministers decided to reduce car fleet limits to zero by 2035, which effectively  corresponds to a ban on ICE vehicles. However, after ongoing discussions and the intervention of Germany, the European Commission was asked to check if ICE vehicles powered exclusively by e-fuels could still be registered after 2035.\nFinally, targets for charging infrastructure deployment \nhave been established in eleven G20 countries. The goals are indicated in the number of charging points and sometimes (as in Japan and South Korea) in the types of chargers (e.g., fast and slow). Indonesia also mentions a target for the number of installed  battery-swapping stations.All in all, the level of ambitions at the national level has increased significantly since 2018. But it remains to be seen whether countries will be able to meet their  targets through effective measures. Many targets from past years have gone unfulfilled. For example,  Germany did not meet its 2020 targets for EV stock and the number of charging points. Several countries were able to satisfy 2020 emission reduction targets in the transport sector, but these achievements can largely be attributed to COVID-19 effects. China was one of the few countries to meet its 2020 targets for public charging points and EV adoption.  \nClimate Strategies for Transport: An Analysis of Nationally  \nDetermined Contributions and Long-Term Strategies\nThis Report analyses trends in transport decarbonisation ambition, targets \nand actions in the climate strategies submitted by countries in the frame -\nwork of the Paris Agreement. Specifically, the analysis focuses on Long-Term \nStrategies (LTS) starting from 2016 and on Nationally Determined Contribu-\ntions (NDCs) starting from 2019. On the basis of the analysis, the report seeks to establish to what extent climate action in transport by countries is on track to deliver on the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming \nbelow 2 \u00b0C. The Report also identifies gaps and shortcomings in the transport \ndimension of these national climate strategies; while it provides recommen-dations on how to enhance it. This October 2022 Update assesses the impact \nof NDCs with targets related to mitigating transport greenhouse gas emis -\nsion on the overall trajectory of transport emissions. Findings show that, if the targets were to be \nmet, the growth of transport emissions would only be slowed down but not put on the radical \ncontention path that is required to support the goal of limiting global warming below 2 \u00b0C.\nSLOCAT (2022), Climate Strategies for Transport: An Analysis of Nationally Determined Contributions  \nand Long-Term Strategies, October 2022 Update.", "start_char_idx": 32976, "end_char_idx": 36221, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e62f14d9-e74d-47e0-82fd-5206332b9e6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e62f14d9-e74d-47e0-82fd-5206332b9e6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "Title: \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\"", "prev_section_summary": "Summary:\nThe section discusses the progress and challenges in decarbonizing global transport, focusing on the commitments made by countries and the effectiveness of their climate policies.

Table 1.2 breaks down the different measures used across G20. The measures apply to specific subsectors such as passenger transport or freight logistics. Furthermore, they concern different modes of transport such as road or rail transport and different opportunities to shift volumes from one mode to another. Almost all G20 countries have policies in place to support the shift to public transport, including action plans or laws to extend services through infrastructure expansion or the renewal of public vehicle fleets. Some countries such as the UK are also striving to improve the con -\nnectivity between different transport modes in public transport. The Canadian programme \u201cInvesting in Canada\u201d has set aside CA$28.7 billion (~USD 21 billion) to make public transportation options more affordable. Germany\u2019s \u201c9-euro ticket\u201d represents a similar effort (although the primary purpose of the test programme was to support citizens during the energy crisis, not decarbonise the transport sector). After a three-month trial phase from June to August 2022, Germany decided to introduce a nationwide successor ticket at a price of 49 euros. Furthermore, eleven of the G20 countries have launched measures to promote the two areas of active mobility: cycling and walking.\nIn the freight sector, many instruments seek to shift \ntransport volumes to rail and inland waterways. As with the passenger sector, the key measures to support the shift include the expansion and upgrade of infra-structure. India plans to establish new rail infrastruc-ture dedicated solely to freight transport. Another important tool to decarbonise the freight sector is the optimisation of logistic systems through the better connectivity of transport modes and the establishment of intermodal hubs. Currently, Japan, UK, and Germany are planning these improvements.\nThe political instruments also differ in their function. While some initiatives are regulatory, others focus on fiscal tools and pricing instruments.

The EU, UK, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, China, India, and the USA also have varying emission standards, with the EU planning further reductions by 2030.

The EU, the UK, and South Korea have emission standards of 95\u201397 g/km for passenger cars. In Brazil, Canada, China, India, and the USA, the fleet limit ranges from 111\u2013128 g/km. In the future, the EU plans to reduce its emission standards to 59g/km (EU) in 2030. \nTypical pricing policies include emission trading sys-tems (ETS) and carbon prices / taxes. The EU plans to \nextend its ETS to the transport sector starting in 2026. China introduced a national ETS in 2021, which ini -\ntially covered only the power sector, but the scope is expected to gradually expand to include domestic avi -\nation. Several other countries \u2013 including Argentina, Mexico, Japan, and South Africa \u2013 have introduced carbon taxes.Not all instruments function in a direct manner. For instance, many important instruments support the purchase of EVs and the roll-out of charging infra-structure, while others try to disincentivise the use of ICE cars. Direct support measures include purchase subsidies, import tax exemptions, and purchase and operational tax exemptions for electric vehicles. Except for Saudi Arabia and South Africa, all G20 countries have initiated support mechanisms for  electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. Indirect measures, also known as \u201cmalus\u201d systems, charge higher costs or taxes for vehicles with high CO\u2082 emis-sions. These kinds of instruments have been intro-duced in France and Italy. \nAltogether, the current landscape of political instru -\nments and measures reflects the high level of ambition \nobserved in NDCs and national targets. \nWhether these measures are adequate for achieving \nstated targets, let alone for satisfying the objectives of the Paris Agreement, would require intensive assess-ment and analysis, which goes beyond the scope of this report. But a closer look at the state of transport decarbonisation in G20 countries could trigger dis-cussions among members and stakeholders about whether enhanced measures are required.Study | 01 | Current national and international targets in transport\n23Transport Emission Scenarios\nThe IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report states \nthat the targets of the 2030 national deter -\nmined contributions (NDCs) submitted prior to COP26 amount to emission reductions that are nowhere near what is needed for 2 \u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b0C pathways (see figure on the \nnext page). Drastic reduction measures would have to be initiated starting in 2030 to enable a return to the 2 \u00b0C pathway, but \neven so, 1.5 \u00b0C would remain out of reach. \n4 \nThe International Transport Forum (ITF) and SLOCAT published extensive reports that include forecasts of transport demand and emissions. According to the latest ITF report, by 2050 CO\u2082 emissions from transport will increase by 16%, even if today\u2019s political commitments are fully implemented (ITF, 2021, p. 14). A strong increase in transport demand is expected to offset policy-led emissions reductions. One of the latest SLOCAT publication states that by 2050 transport emissions have to drop by two-thirds relative to 2019 levels, or 8\u00a0gigatonnes, to achieve Paris Agreement targets.\n5\n4  IPCC 2022\n5  SLOCAT 2021SLOCAT has developed several forecast scenarios for transport-sector emissions. These are depicted in the graphic below. The simulation data do not yet include COVID-19 effects and the associated decline in global transport emissions.\nThe \u201cBAU HIGH\u201d assumes a business-as-usual development for mobility patterns and investment trends.

The EU, UK, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, China, India, and the USA also have varying emission standards, with the EU planning further reductions by 2030.

Methods analysing departure and destination countries offer a more detailed picture, but compiling the data is complex and gaps may \n11  EDGAR 2021arise. In addition, they do not take into account emissions caused by transport operations that are initiated by one country but originate and terminate elsewhere. The approximation method based on GDP requires less effort, and is supported by the strong link between a country\u2019s wealth and high levels of commercial air travel and container shipping. The method based on national emissions attributes a smaller amount of international aviation and shipping emissions to countries with a high share of nuclear or hydropower supply. These countries may still be very active in international transport, however.\nThe figure on the next page compares emission \nestimates for international aviation and shipping  produced from three different methods.\nRegardless the method, China, the USA, and the \nEuropean Union account for the largest amounts of emissions from international shipping and aviation, followed by India and Japan. When comparing the approaches, however, aviation and shipping emis-sions are higher when using the emissions method for China compared with the GDP technique.\nBy contrast, the emissions method results in lower \nvalues for the USA, the EU and Japan compared with the GDP method. The IEA data show the lowest emissions for China, India and Japan among all three methods both in the case of aviation and shipping. For the EU, the IEA data result in the highest emissions in international aviation and shipping.

Brazil has the highest share of \nrenewable energy at over 80% (2019) due to its high share of hydropower.\nBesides the increased share of renewables in the elec-\ntricity grid, increased efficiency leads to a decarboni -\nsation of energy supply and declining emission grid factors in G20 countries. The figure on the right shows a clear declining trend of emission intensities across most G20 countries. Some countries saw a deteriora-tion and increase in the 2021 emissions factors as the post-COVID economic recovery was driven by fossil sources to a greater extent than by renewables. Coun -\ntries such as Australia or Japan, however, were able to achieve a further decline in their emission factors in 2021. The average decline rate of the emission grid factors between 2015 and 2020 across G20 countries amounted to around 12%.\nAlmost all countries have ambitions to raise their \nshare of renewables. For instance, Germany wants to reach 65% by 2030, while the USA wants to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. \nBut the challenge lies in including the future electricity \ndemand from EVs in the ramp-up of renewables. In its STEPS forecast, the IEA expects an aggregated elec-tricity demand for EV charging of 800,000 GWh for China, India, the EU, and the USA by 2030. In its SDS projection, it expects a demand of 1 million GWh for the same group of countries.In all G20 countries, fossil fuels in the transport sector are subsidised or exempted from fuel taxation in some form. Examples of financial support are fuel tax credits for businesses (e.g. Australia), tax reductions or exemptions (e.g., Brazil, USA, Germany, France, and many other countries), direct payments to taxi drivers and public transport (China), customs duty reductions for crude oil (India), and generous funding for the exploration, extraction, and refining of oil products and for the stockpiling of crude oil (Japan). In order to promote the switch to electric vehicles and increase ambitions to reach climate goals in the trans-port sector, it is imperative that countries eliminate these subsidies. Moreover, they must not only support EV use but disincentivise the use of ICE vehicles and fuel consumption by means of malus systems. \nOver recent years, there have been efforts to reform \nfiscal aid for fossil-fuel sectors (e.g., in Canada and France).

For the first time in history, the G20 is on track to see three emerging economies in a row at its helm: \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026\nIndonesia in 2022, India in 2023, and Brazil in 2024. South Africa is in line to become the fourth, in 2025, though this has yet to be formally announced. After the notable increase of attention on transport-related matters at COP26, the G20 is expected to give greater priority to transport decarbonisation. Though COP27 did not provide substantial further impetus for increased ambition in this area, the LOTUS initiative introduced in Sharm El Sheikh addresses urban mobility challenges specifically in the Global South. This section provides a short snapshot of transport-related decarbonisation measures with regard to the G20 presidency of Indonesia and the directions the subject is expected to take during the presidencies of India and Brazil.\nINDONESIA \u2013 2022\nStudy | 03 | The Indonesian, Indian, Brazil G20 presidencies\n413\ufffd1 Indonesia \u2013 2022\nThe Republic of Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest island \ncountry and, for the past decade, its fastest growing emerging economy after China and India. It is also the world\u2019s eighth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and as such plays a key role in the global effort to meet Paris Climate Agreement goals.\nThe country assumed the G20 presidency in Novem -\nber 2021, just as the world was tentatively starting to \nthink beyond the pandemic. The multidimensional crisis needed a collaborative global effort, and Indone-sia believed that the G20 could drive the global recov -\nery. For the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia chose the motto \u201cRecover Together, Recover Stronger\u201d .Indonesia prioritised the global health architecture for the G20. During its presidency, it has also strongly advocated technological and financial support to help developing countries achieve a sustainable energy transition, especially the $100 billion a year in climate funding promised by developed countries in 2009. Lastly, Indonesia has emphasised the role of the G20 in advancing global discussions regarding an equitable digital transformation. Unfortunately, the decarboni -\nsation of the transport sector has not featured in any G20 declaration or work stream under Indonesia\u2019s leadership.Indonesia\u2019s Nationally Determined  \nContribution (NDC)Indonesia submitted its updated NDC to the UNFCCC in July 2021. Later that year, at the COP26, it announced a net-zero target by 2060 or sooner. Indo-nesia has not yet revised its 2030 emission reduction targets in its 2015 NDC \u2013 29% without international support or 41% with international support relative to the business-as-usual scenario. The 2021 update reasserted the country\u2019s intention to retire all coal-fired power plants by 2055. Notably, over 97% of the reduction target will be in the forest, land, and energy sectors. Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (EMR) has developed a roadmap for renew -\nables to increase the country\u2019s share in power genera-tion to 23% by 2025, 57% by 2035, and 93% by 2045. While the transport sector accounts for one-third of the country\u2019s energy consumption and 40% of CO\u2082 emissions from final energy consumption, Indonesia has yet to set CO\u2082 targets for the sector and has focused instead on the adoption of biofuels.\nTransport\nWith 6,000 inhabited islands among 17,000 islands in all, Indonesia relies heavily on inter-island transport links. The larger islands of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi have extensive transport systems dominated by roads. Many of the smaller, less developed islands have incomplete, fragmented, and poorly maintained road networks for internal travel and underdeveloped infrastructure for inter-island shipping. Java and Sumatra both have rail networks, but freight transport is limited. The air sector is growing rapidly due in part to the emergence of discount airlines. \nIndonesia\u2019s policy agenda includes the expansion and \nimprovement of transport infrastructure, and since 2014 the country has seen 16 new airports, 18 new ports, and 2,100 km of new toll roads.\n14 The country \nhas set targets for its modal share as well, with the aim of increasing passenger rail to 7\u20139% and freight rail to 11\u201313% of their respective totals by 2030.

For India, it was a step towards achieving India\u2019s long-term goal of reaching net-zero by 2070.  The core targets of India\u2019s NDC are to reduce the emis-sions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 relative to 2005 levels, to ensure that 50% of its installed electric-ity capacity is from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and val -\nues of conservation and moderation through the gov -\nernment\u2019s flagship Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Envi -\nronment).  India\u2019s NDC targets and priorities are likely to form a realistic outline for other emerging economies and to further encourage international discussions of climate action under the G20 umbrella. New agreements, shared responsibilities, and obligatory international cooperation are expected to constitute the core ele-ments of India\u2019s leadership. The country\u2019s updated NDC follows the stance it took at the COP26 on the transfer of funding and low-cost climate technologies from developing countries. In its NDC, India reiterated that \u201cnew and additional financial resources as well as the transfer of technology are the commitments and responsibilities of the developed countries under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement\u201d . TransportThe movement of people and goods is the backbone of India\u2019s fast-paced economic development. India\u2019s strong emphasis on socioeconomic growth and the pace of its urbanisation has increased its mobility demand. As a result, transport emissions rose from 105\u00a0Mt CO\u2082 in 2000 to 325 Mt CO\u2082 in 2019. While transport related emissions grew by 18.4% from 2015 to 2019, per capita emissions grew by 13.5% in the same period. Despite strong growth rates, however, its per capita emissions \u2013 0.25 metric tons CO\u2082 \u2013 are the lowest in the G20.India\u2019s total CO\u2082 emissions from fuel combustion increased by 375% between 1990 and 2019, yet they represent a relatively low share of total emissions \u2013 only 14%. Among other reasons, this is due to the high carbon intensity of India\u2019s power generation. Never -\ntheless, transport sector emissions could increase 65% by 2030 and 197% by 2050 relative to 2020 levels. Road transport is the main contributor to sector emissions, followed by rail transport. The nearly 7% of sector emis-sions from rail is one of the highest shares in the G20.\nIndia is committed to further increasing the share of \nrail in freight transport to 45% by 2030. The country aims to have a 30% share of electric LDV sales by 2030 and the government is working on plans to require all two-wheelers to be electric by 2026.

Since 2010, reverse auctions have been used to procure solar PV and solar thermal capacity; since 2017, these auctions have also been used for wind energy. Additional programmes support rooftop solar solutions and solar agricultural pumps through grant schemes. The solar cities programme aims to convert one city per state to run completely on solar power.\nThere is significant uncertainty over the future of coal power capacity in India. In the recent Third Biennial Report to the UNFCCC, India highlighted its desire to continue with coal, citing its need for development and energy security. While India has been reducing its share of coal power development, it remains the second largest coal pipeline globally after China, and has over 200 GW of coal-fired capacity in operation (11% of global capacity). The CEA projects that the capacity will increase to almost 266 GW by 2029\u20132030, and potentially reach 300 GW given the number of coal projects in the pipeline. Obviously, this planned increase is not consistent with the Paris Agreement.  \nTo produce a Paris Agreement compatible pathway, India\u2019s coal power generation would need to decrease immediately to a share of 5\u201310% by 2030 and be phased out before 2040\n28.

The country published its second NDC update in March 2022, when Jair Bolsonaro was still president. The country reiterated its commitment to achieving climate neutrality in 2050, with interim greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of 37% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 relative to 2005 levels. The 2022 NDC also contained improved percentage reduction targets vis-a-vis the country\u2019s first update in 2020. But the second update also included increases in short-term emissions compared with the previous NDC \u2013 314 million tonnes in 2025 and 82 million tonnes in 2030. The 2022 update also fails to clarify earlier pledges such as the elimination of deforestation by 2030 or Brazil\u2019s signing of the Global Methane Pledge. Furthermore, none of the NDC drafts contain transport-sector-specific targets for 2030. The head of Lula\u2019s environmental team promised in October 2022 to submit an updated NDC proposal if he wins the election. Transport In Brazil, the world\u2019s fifth-largest country by area, long travel distances are the norm. It is no surprise that it has 4,000 domestic airports, more than most other countries worldwide but one (USA). Yet in most parts of the country transport infrastructure is underdevel -\noped and poorly maintained, posing a major obstacle to the movement of freight and people. The best devel -\noped infrastructure is along the coastline and in the southeast, around the densely populated metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. But the further inland you go, the sparser and worse it becomes.\n31 \nBrazil\u2019s total CO\u2082 emissions from fuel combustion increased by 98% between 1990 and 2020. Emission increases in the transport sector have outpaced those from fuel combustion in general, growing 136% during the same period. The domestic transport sector is responsible for 47% of emissions from fuel combustion. This is due to the large percentage of renewables (84%) in Brazil\u2019s energy generation. The country\u2019s per capita emissions from transport are below the G20 and world averages.\nIn Brazil, road is the most used mode of transport, and \npassenger cars are the most common motorised form. For every 1,000 inhabitants in 2020, 330 own a car, while only 137 own motorcycles and 22 own utility vehicles.

We elaborate on recent sector developments, highlight the countries\u2019 NDCs and national targets, and spotlight factors impacting domestic transportation needs. \nOur mobility indicators provide insight into motorisa-\ntion rates and transport volumes, while our energy- related indicators show fuel use, gasoline and diesel prices, and the status of electric vehicle adoption.  Furthermore, the factsheets peek over the rim of the \u201ctransport box\u201d , providing some information regarding the closely linked energy sector.\nData availability in the transport sector is limited, and \ndata quality is often poor. When available, we have used consistent datasets, such as those from the IEA, the World Bank, EDGAR, OECD, and the International Transport Forum. In some cases, we supplement these data with other sources, such as national data or inter -\nnational studies. Accordingly, the data are not neces-sarily fully comparable between countries. However, they effectively serve their main purpose: to enhance our understanding of the situation in individual coun -\ntries, and to identify significant differences between countries. Information on all data sources can be found in annex\u00a0I.\nThis report does not assess implemented measures \nwith a view to their stringency or how far they are able to achieve stated goals or the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The factsheets present measures  that from their design or intention could potentially contribute to mitigation. \nNational sources are not always available in English. \nDue to resource constraints, we were not able to ana-lyse all potentially relevant documents, so additional measures may exist.\nA core aim of the factsheets is to assess the level of \nambition in each nation, including the steps taken to implement the measures we have identified. NDCs represent the internationally declared targets for cli -\nmate action, and they often serve as a basis for ambi -\ntion at the international level. The factsheets summa-rise each country\u2019s overall commitment, transport related targets included in the NDC, and mitigation measures and action relevant to transport. Addition -\nally, the factsheets show the national targets that countries have set for the transport sector or individ -\nual subsectors, if they exist.G20 Transport Sector Factsheets: Our Contribution to Enhanced TransparencyAgora Verkehrswende | Towards Decarbonising Transport 2023\n56MOBILITY\nURBANISATION\nNDCPOPULATION\nARGENTINA\nEV  \nTARGETSARGENTINA\n57Rail infrastructure\n Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions data from 2020 might show a misleading declining trend.

Mexico's transport-sector emissions increased by 143% between 1990 and 2019 but dropped by 29% in 2020 due to the pandemic. Transport is responsible for 37% of Mexico's total emissions, with road transport accounting for 97% of these emissions.\n\n6. **Energy Sector Linkages**: The section also discusses the role of electric vehicles, renewable electricity targets, gasoline and diesel prices, and the CO\u2082 intensity of power. Studies on hydrogen's market potential and battery reuse and recycling initiatives are mentioned.\n\nKey entities include:\n- Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles\n- Electric vehicles\n- Fuel-cell vehicles\n- Low Carbon City Act (Eco-City Act)\n- Act on Advancement of Integration and Streamlining of Distribution Business\n- Mexico\n- International Energy Agency (IEA)\n- REN21\n- Globalpetrolprices.com\n\nThe section provides a comprehensive overview of policies, measures, and data related to decarbonizing the transport sector within the G20 context, with a specific focus on Mexico.", "section_summary": "Summary:\nThe excerpt from the document titled \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\" covers several key topics and entities related to energy use and climate policies in the transport sector, particularly focusing on Mexico. Key points include:\n\n1. **Battery Management**: Importers and distributors of batteries are required to create management plans for waste prevention and recycling, aiming to reduce recycling costs.\n2. **Energy Use in Transport**: Various fuel types are discussed, including biofuels, biodiesels, biogasoline, biogases, fuel oil, gas/diesel oil excluding biofuels, electricity, fossil aviation fuels, motor gasoline excluding biofuels, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and natural gas.\n3. **Energy Transition in Mexico**: Natural gas has largely replaced oil for power generation. Mexico's energy sustainability goals involve a quota system based on clean-energy certificates (CEC), supported by the Energy Reform bill initiated in 2013-2014. Retail suppliers must buy CECs to meet clean energy quotas, which increase annually.\n4. **Electric Vehicle Infrastructure**: Data on publicly accessible charging infrastructure in 2021 shows the number of slow and fast charging units, with comparisons to G20 averages. The share of electric cars in the total passenger car stock and market share of new electric car sales in 2021 are also highlighted.\n5. **Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic exacerbated Mexico's economic recession in 2020, leading to an 8.2% contraction. Emissions from the transport sector decreased by 24% in 2020, the second highest drop in the G20. Mobility levels in 2020 were significantly below pre-pandemic levels, with recovery observed in car and walking mobility by 2021, while public transport recovered later in the year.\n6. **National Climate Targets**: Mexico's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) include a commitment to a 22% reduction in GHG emissions and a 51% reduction in black carbon by 2030. With international support, these targets increase to a 36% reduction in GHG emissions and a 70% reduction in black carbon by 2030.\n\nEntities mentioned include SEMARNAT, IEA, OECD, and the IEA EV Data Explorer."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "23d4adb0-5df9-41f8-809e-1a46eee8caf4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab40f3b5c92c610c2d111d6b36576cf2ea1c655ed34035104234b8ea0375d73b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fd481a2-60a7-4d92-b4a1-98a7a64c52af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8c93bc92bc33ecd156273acb959d6e25b548e1c650a3c1683a841bac78309bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae0ba9f8-cc86-4de5-907f-94486bb8d11e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "691ccb0fc7a49705e968c81f2bbcbdbd260a87f0cdb31312abb5029a03569c7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "importers, and distributors of batteries must formulate management plans for the prevention of waste and for recycling, including the reduction of recycling costs \ufffdEnergy use in transport by fuel\nOther liquid biofuels\nBiodieselsBiogasolineBiogasesFuel oilGas/diesel oil excl \ufffd biofuels\nElectricityTotal fossil aviation fuelsMotor gasoline excl \ufffd biofuels\nLiquefied petroleum gas (LPG)Natural gas1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0Biofuels &  \nrenewable  \nelectricity*\nFossil fuels\n02000004000006000008000001000000120000014000001600000\n-60000 -40000 -20000 020000 40000 60000 80000 100000\nProduction Imports Exports Stock changesTransport fuels  \n(excl. biofuels)Crude oil &  \noil products\n[1,000 kt]-60 20 0 -20 40 60 80 100 -40\n Source: SEMARNAT Source: IEA (2021)0102030405060708090\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019[Million TJ]\n[gCO\u2082/kWh]  \nIndex values: 2000 = 100Natural gas has largely replaced oil as the main fuel source \nfor power generation in Mexico \ufffd The country's energy \nsustainability goals are to be met with a quota system based on clean-energy certificates (CEC)\ufffd These efforts are supported by the country's Energy Reform bill, which started liberalizing the energy market in 2013\u20132014 \ufffd Retail suppliers \nare required to have a given share of their electricity from clean sources \ufffd In practice, they must buy CECs to \ndemonstrate that they have complied with the quotas \ufffd This \nobligation is set on an annual base, and increases every year\ufffd The quota for 2022 is 13\ufffd 9%\ufffd Three rounds of renewable \nenergy auctions were held, but then halted\ufffd Energy reforms currently under discussion could reverse incentives and encouragechanges in dispatch regulation \ufffd\n100%\n94.3\n-1.4\n37.4\n-7.0-59.5\n-0.60\n27.2\nSource: IEA EV Data ExplorerPUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE (2021)\n1,200 *\nSLOW CHARGE92 *\nFAST CHARGE\n28,789 *\nSLOW CHARGE \nG20 AVERAGE 43,927  *\nFAST CHARGE G20 AVERAGE \n*number of units89.24 93.730.06%\nSHARE OF ELECTRIC CARS IN \nTOTAL PASSENGER CAR STOCK (2021)\nELECTRIC CAR FLEET BY VEHICLE TYPE (2015 VS. 2021)0.50%\nMARKET SHARE OF ELECTRIC CARS  IN NEW SALES (2021)\n+4,555.9%\nTOTAL FLEET GROWTH (2015\u20132021)11,500  \nvehicles\nTOTAL STOCK OF \nELECTRIC CARS (2021)\n Source: IEA EV Data Explorer[1,000 vehicles]2015\n20210 2 4 6 8 10 120\n000012AMBITION\nTRADE-OFFS\nCOVID108\nIMPLEMENTATIONSource: OECD\nIn Mexico, the already ongoing recession was exacer -\nbated in 2020 by the pandemic, leading to an eco -\nnomic contraction of 8 \ufffd2%\ufffd Growth resumed in 2021 \nwith 4 \ufffd8%\ufffd In Mexico, emissions from the transport \nsector decreased by 24% in 2020, the second highest \ndrop in the G20 \ufffd Overall mobility in 2020 remained well below pre-pandemic levels for all transport modes \ufffd In 2021 mobility by car and walking started to \nrecover and rose substantially above levels before the pandemic \ufffd Public transport only managed to recover \nprevious levels in late 2021 \ufffd NDCs and national climate targets \nGeneral NDC targetsCommitted to a 22% reduction in GHG emissions and  \na 51% reduction in black carbon by 2030;

Key topics include:\n\n1. **Economic Impact of COVID-19**: Russia's economy contracted by 4-6% in 2020, with transport sector emissions decreasing by 6% due to reduced mobility.\n2. **Public Transport Ridership**: Public transport ridership in Russia fell by around 50% in March 2020 but recovered by August. Another decline occurred in October, with a 30% drop by January 2021. Ridership normalized by May 2021, while driving and walking remained above pre-pandemic levels.\n3. **Energy and Emission Standards**: Russia lacks energy/carbon emission standards for both light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). There are no CO\u2082 or energy consumption-based taxes, and no mandatory vehicle labeling.\n4. **Support Mechanisms for Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The national strategy adopted in March 2018 supports domestic vehicle production, including EVs. The 2021 'Concept for the production and use of electric vehicles until 2030' includes incentives for local EV production and consumer stimulus. Import taxes for EVs were suspended on 31 December 2021.\n5. **Fossil-Fuel Subsidies**: In 2020, fossil-fuel subsidies in the transport sector amounted to approximately 10,663 million USD (627.20 billion RUB).\n6. **Biofuels and Public Transport**: There is no focus on supporting biofuels.

Given the role of transport as a backbone for economic activ -\nity, international climate action must give adequate attention to the sector \u2013 not least because transport is the only sector in which notable reductions have not been achieved since 1990. Quite to the contrary: transport emissions have been spiking on the back of increasing motorisation around the globe.\nThe G20 confirmed its steadfast commitment to the \nParis Agreement at the 2022 summit in Bali. In the official statement from this summit, the G20 under -\nlined the \u201curgency to rapidly transform and diversify energy systems\u201d and declared its dedication to \u201caccel -\nerating and ensuring clean, sustainable, just, afforda-ble, and inclusive energy transitions\u201d while also encouraging the \u201cflow of sustainable investments\u201d .\nDue to the pandemic and growing geopolitical ten -\nsions, the international commitment to climate action \nis currently facing challenges with even the strong economies of the G20 coming under significant pres-sure. The fact that climate action is not being accorded the necessary attention is apparent in the specific content of the Bali G20 declaration, including lack of reference to the importance of decarbonizing and reshaping transport. Individual G20 members face divergent challenges when it comes to socioeconomic transformation in general and the remaking of the transport sector in particular. China and India still have relatively low per capita emissions, but absolute transport-related emissions have increased dramati -\ncally in recent years. The transformation of the energy sector towards renewable energy is a difficult task for most countries, in part because of the need for robust change in core economic sectors, such as vehicle man -\nufacturing. In addition, current tectonic shifts in geo-politics mean greater economic competition between China, India, and Indonesia, on the one hand, and the US, Western Europe, and Japan, on the other.\nDivergent challenges to effective climate action are \nalso evident in the disparity between industrialised and emerging economies. All international actors need to expand their ambition. But while emerging econo-mies need to address rapid motorisation and stagger -\ning growth rates in the transport sector, industrialised countries, by contrast, need to bring down high per capita emissions, and, by extension, total emission levels. COP26 has seen an unprecendeted number of new transport related commitments, yet policies thus far have not resulted in an observable slowing of existing trends. Regretably, COP27 has also failed to trigger accelerated action in transport. On a positive note, there was no retreat from existing  commitments. \nDuring the G20 presidency of India, experts hope that transport and the decoupling of emissions from eco-nomic growth will play a more central role in the nation\u2019s agenda. By providing insight into national decarbonisation trends, this report aims to serve as a basis for discussion as well as an impetus for policy direction.\nHaving a clear and ambitious vision for the future of \nthe transport sector is crucial for bringing about radi -\ncal change in the movement of people and goods. In this regard, an important first step is formulating a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and setting corresponding targets in national energy policy. How -\never, setting targets is a futile endeavour in the absence of clear policies and measures that will bring about their attainment. Legislators must pass laws that encourage the testing and implementation of new ideas and concepts. Yet they must also promote the accelerated expansion of proven low carbon systems and ensure policies take a holistic approach, address-ing the linkages to other sectors, such as energy and land use.", "start_char_idx": 356301, "end_char_idx": 361356, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e9691f1-d900-403a-ba2e-e5a82b54df02": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e9691f1-d900-403a-ba2e-e5a82b54df02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "Title: \"Decarbonising Global Transport: A Comparative Analysis of G20 Sectoral Ambition, Climate Policies, and Emission Pathways\"", "prev_section_summary": "Summary:\nThe section discusses the critical need for decarbonizing the global transport sector, particularly within G20 economies, which are major contributors to global GHG emissions.

Legislators must pass laws that encourage the testing and implementation of new ideas and concepts. Yet they must also promote the accelerated expansion of proven low carbon systems and ensure policies take a holistic approach, address-ing the linkages to other sectors, such as energy and land use.\nPublic transport infrastructure, for example, will be \nkey not only to reducing GHG emissions in passenger transport, but also to improving the quality of urban life by reducing congestion, air pollution and traffic fatalities.\nThe broader changes needed to transform the trans-\nport sector are illustrated with the aid of the diagram shown in figure 5.1. The \u201cmobility transition\u201d is about changing how people get around. Its goal is decreasing final energy consumption in the transport sector Agora Verkehrswende | Towards Decarbonising Transport 2023\n140without restricting individual mobility. The \u201cenergy \ntransition in transport\u201d refers to the technological transformation needed to serve mobility demand more efficiently while generating lower emissions (Agora Verkehrswende 2017a). The success of the \u201ctransport transformation\u201d as a whole thus rests on both a \u201cmobil -\nity transition\u201d and an \u201cenergy transition in transport\u201d . \nThe model is a further elaboration of the \u201cAvoid, Shift \nand Improve\u201d strategy, which is at the core of the transport transformation. Avoid\u2013Shift\u2013Improve approaches are critical for achieving a just energy transition in transport. Fortunately, G20 countries have already begun this important work.\nFossil fuel subsidy reform can realign market signals to \navoid unnecessary vehicle trips and accelerate the uptake of renewable electricity for low-carbon mobil -\nity. From 2014 to 2017, India incrementally reduced oil and gas subsidies by 75%, while increasing funding for renewable energy six-fold. Indonesia has reallocated some fossil fuel subsidies for education, health, and infrastructure projects, including renewables and  public transport.\nIncreasing investments to more energy-efficient \nmeans of passenger and freight transport can also help shift consumer demand toward lower-carbon trans-port. Saudi Arabia has launched high-speed rail to boost development and relieve congestion. Turkey is developing 16 new high-speed rail lines to triple its network length by 2023. France has banned short domestic flights that can be easily replaced by rail. Brazil aims to double the share of its freight trans-ported via rail by 2035, and India has set a target to move at least 50% of goods via rail by 2030 and fully electrify its rail system by 2024. Argentina is adopting new freight technologies to reduce transport emis-sions by 8.4% by 2030. Though not a silver bullet for transport decarbonisa-tion, electric vehicles can improve energy efficiency by producing about 20% less CO\u2082 emissions than internal combustion engines. Private companies such as Audi and Jaguar (supported by GridCars) are install -\ning public charging stations in South Africa in major hubs and along frequently travelled routes. In India, two- and three-wheelers are the most widely used modes of transport.

Lastly, Brazil, in order to meet the growing \ndemand for electric buses, has launched a domestic manufacturing and assembly industry with various companies, including BYD, Daimler, and Eletra. \nGoing forward, it is important that countries continue \nto focus on avoid and shift measures in addition to direct electrification.

This will lower energy demand in the transport sector while increasing the supply of renewable energy for other uses.\nMore rapid action is needed\nDelayed action will require more painful changes later While there were promising policy developments in some countries over the last years, far more ambition is needed in the transport sector to achieve the objec-tives of the Paris Agreement and to uphold the com -\nmitments from COP26. The year-over-year growth in transport-sector emissions showed a marginal decrease of -0.15% in 2019 and some G20 countries in fact have witnessed a reduction in emissions since 2015. However, overall G20 transport emissions grew by almost 6% in 2015\u20132019.\nOnly a few countries are moving forward  \nwith new action Despite some positive trends in the area of fuel effi -\nciency, ICE phase out, emission standards, and EV pol -\nicy support, new large-scale measures to support the rapid decarbonisation of the transport sector are still lacking.A focus on fuel standards and electrification  \nis not enough Not enough focus on changing mobility patternsSince 2018 many countries have taken steps towards the electrification of road transport, setting objectives for EV penetration, sales, and charging infrastructure, although with varying degrees of ambition. In many cases, these objectives are backed up with specific support policies.\nA sole focus on vehicle technology will not be sufficient for decarbonisation given a growing population, increasing motorisation rates, and growing vehicle sizes. Indeed, more efficient transport systems are essential for achieving a decarbonisation pathway in the trans -\nport sector. Measures that support a shift to more effi -\ncient, less carbon-intensive modes of transport remain too few and far between. While all countries are invest -\ning in public transport infrastructure, this investment has often failed to keep pace with rising demand. Greater efforts are needed to develop new mobility services and make public transport, low-carbon freight alternatives, and non-motorised transport more attractive.\nMeasures that reduce transport demand without compromising mobility are neededThe G20\u2019s 2019 Energy Efficiency Leading Programme (EELP) recognised the importance of \u201cbehavioral change\u201d . While such recognition was a welcome first step, little has been achieved since then, and the 2022 Bali summit has not provided any impetus for action in the transport sector. Further, the pandemic and geopo-litical shifts appear to have dampened national ambi -\ntions. Countries need to implement policies that reduce transport demand. Modern communication technolo-gies are an important catalyser of change in this area, for they enable optimised traffic routing and provide alternatives to travel, such as videoconferencing.\nIn this regard, it is important to remember that \n harnessing the power of information technology to lower transport demand necessitates broad access to reliable, high-speed communication infrastructure.\nOngoing efficiency efforts must be complemented  \nby measures to reduce vehicle weight One development undermining efforts to augment the energy efficiency of light duty vehicles is the trend toward larger, heavier vehicles such as SUVs, even for battery electric vehicles. To ensure that efficiency gains ultimately achieve envisaged carbon reductions, measures need to be tailored in a way that encourages the use of smaller, lighter vehicles.\nElectricity used in the transport sector needs to \ncome from renewablesSupport measures that target electrification or  power-to-X technologies should be linked to  renewable requirementsGreater electrification of land-based transport and the expansion of power-to-X fuels for aviation and ship-ping will only encourage decarbonisation assuming Agora Verkehrswende | Towards Decarbonising Transport 2023\n142that there is a greater reliance on zero or low carbon \nelectricity. Grid emission factors allow us to observe progress in the energy transition of the power sector. In G20 countries, however, this statistic is not declin -\ning at the required pace. While most countries show at least moderate improvement in grid emission factors, four G20 countries \u2013 namely, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, and South Africa \u2013 now have higher GHG emissions per kWh in relation to 1990.\nMarket ramp-up of power-to-X fuels requires \n intensified collaboration and investmentWhile the direct use of electricity is the most efficient means of lowering the GHG emissions of road trans-port, long-haul aviation and maritime shipping will remain dependent on energy dense fuels.

So-called power-to-X fuels provide a pathway for the replace-ment of conventional fossil energy carriers with car -\nbon-neutral alternatives. However, to achieve the desired impact of lowering net-CO\u2082 emissions, green power-to-X fuels must be produced in substantial quantities \u2013 and as of 2022, the industry is still in a nascent state.\nG20 member states should take a leading role in the \nmarket-ramp up of power-to-X by adopting ambitious policies that increase available funding while also pro-viding guarantees for investors. Cooperation between member states can be enhanced by fostering Just Energy Transition Partnerships and by introducing support for power-to-X technologies in partnership agreements. In third countries with favorable produc-tion potential, G20 countries can act as enablers by setting up partnerships on equal terms as part of  projects for direct foreign investment and technology transfer. \nFossil-fuel subsidies should be eliminated \nMany countries have started to reduce fossil-fuel  subsidies, such as India, which phased out price  controls for transport fuels in late 2014. However, overall subsidy levels are still distorting the market, giving carbon-intensive modes of transport an undue advantage.\nRevenues spent or forfeited to finance fossil-fuel \n subsidies could instead be used to enhance the  availability and cost-competitiveness of public trans-port and to support both the electrification of vehicles and the market uptake of electricity-based zero carbon fuels for aviation and shipping. \nEliminating effects that distort the price of fossil fuels \nwould also support a higher share of renewables in the power mix. As electrification is an important tool in many countries for addressing local air pollution, a shift towards fully renewable power generation would help to reduce GHG emissions in the power sector while also supporting zero-carbon transport options.G20 activities should reflect the need for  integrated system approaches Thinking \u201coutside-of-the-box\u201d is required Many of the necessary developments in the transport sector, such as electrification and digitalisation, require close integration with other sectors. The organisational structure of G20 working groups and task forces should reflect this fact. To date, the G20 has yet to establish a work stream dedicated to transform -\ning transport. By pooling expertise of IT, transport,  and power grid experts, it should be possible to iden -\ntify measures that can promote greater integration between the power and transport sectors, and, by extension, guide the decarbonisation of the transport sector and energy economy as a whole.\n Study | 05 | Summary and recommendations\n14306\nREFERENCES\n14506 | References\nADB (2021).

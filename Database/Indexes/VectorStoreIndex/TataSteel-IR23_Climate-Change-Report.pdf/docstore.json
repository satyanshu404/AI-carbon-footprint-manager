It has wide scale applications \nfor renewable energy, low-CO2 \ntransportation, large-scale hydrogen \nproduction and distribution, carbon \ncapture, usage & storage, electric \nvehicles, sustainable buildings and \ndelivering major infrastructure projects \nwhich will help nations to achieve their \nclimate goals. \nAt the same time, it is important \nto recognise that the steel making \nindustry is a hard to abate sector, as \n70% of global production is through \nthe blast furnace route which relies on \ncoal. This traditional technology has \nhad the benefit of cost competitiveness, \nenergy efficiency (as coal is both a \nreductant and source of energy) and \nthe ability to produce value added and \ndifferentiated grades of steel. Around \n30% of global steel production uses \nthe Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) and can \nuse scrap as feedstock. This has less \ncarbon intensity than the Blast Furnace \nroute but consumes more electricity \nand is not yet able to produce the entire \nrange of value-added grades of steel. \nMoreover, the majority of global scrap \nis generated in economically mature \nregions (like USA, Europe), with a history \nof significant legacy investments in \ninfrastructure. \nSteelmakers around the world are \nfaced with the challenge of adopting \na pathway towards reduction of the \nemission intensity of their produced \nsteel. The pathways would have to be \ncontextualised on the appropriateness of resource availability in relevant \ngeographies, a just transition in the \necosystem and supply chain, and a \nviable technological solution that is \nfinancially sustainable. The financial \ninvestments required for progressing \ntowards net zero will be very significant \nand require three critical enablers: \n \u2212availability of fiscal support to make \nthe transition viable and affordable  \n \u2212policy support towards \ninfrastructure development for new \nenergy\n \u2212the value chain\u2019s demand for low \ncarbon greener steel products.  \nA number of the potential \ntechnology solutions are being \nevaluated for decarbonisation  and are \nat various stages of development. It is \nexpected that a bouquet of solutions \nwould emerge over the next decade.  \nAs a responsible corporate citizen, \nTata Steel has always placed strong \nemphasis on environment, social and \ngovernance aspects while designing its \ncorporate strategy across all its business \noperations. In the FY 2022-23 (Global \nComment), the Company adopted the \ntarget to be net zero across its entire \nglobal operations by the year 2045. This \nis also in line with the Tata Group target \nas part of Project Alingana (embrace \nsustainability) and is an ambitious \nendeavour underlining the Company\u2019s \nstrong commitment to sustainability. \nTata Steel is seeking to put in place \nbespoke de-carbonisation plans for \nour steelmaking operations in India \nand Europe that are anchored around \nthe demand for low carbon steel \nproducts in the individual geographies, the regulatory development in the \nregion, availability of viable transition \noptions and fiscal and policy support \nfor the transition. Tata Steel continues \nto promote circularity and in addition \nto our electric arc based steel making \nfacilities in Thailand that recycles steel \nscrap and have very low CO2 emission \nintensity, in India too, the Company \nhas taken the initiative to set up its first \nscrap based greenfield EAF steelmaking \nfacility in Punjab.

Strategy\nWithin the overall strategic \nframework of transition to low carbon \nbusiness configuration, Tata Steel\u2019s \ndecarbonisation pathway is nuanced \nin each geography based on local \nregulatory context, policy support, \navailability of competitively priced \ngreen energy and the associated \ndelivery infrastructure and customers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for green steel.\nIndia\nTata Steel currently has an installed \ncapacity of 21.6 MnTPA of steelmaking \nin India across its production sites. \nThese include three major sites \nJamshedpur (11 MnTPA), Kalinganagar \n(3 MnTPA) and Meramandali (5.6 \nMnTPA), all of which consume iron ore \nand coking coal in blast furnaces to \nproduce steel. In FY2022-23, Tata Steel \ncompleted the acquisition of Neelachal \nIspat Nigam Limited (NINL), which \nneighbours Tata Steel\u2019s Kalinganagar \nsite, has now ramped up production \nat NINL to 1 MnTPA, and is also reliant \non blast furnace technology.  Finally, \nthrough Tata Steel Long Products, \nTata Steel operates 1 MnTPA of EAF \ntechnology to produce speciality \nlong products at its Gamharia site in \nJamshedpur and this too is fed by hot \nmetal.India is currently the second-largest \nsteel-producing country in the world. \nThe National Steel Policy of India \nenvisages 300 MnTPA steel production \nin India by 2030, and local demand is \nexpected to continue to increase 4-5 \ntimes of current levels by the middle \nof this century. Accordingly, Tata Steel \nhas a stated ambition to double its \nsteelmaking capacity in India to  \n40 MnTPA. \nThis growth trajectory poses its own \ndecarbonisation challenges for the \nlargely blast furnace based Indian steel \nindustry. Currently, the constraint is \nthe availability of competitively priced \nlow carbon fuel (Green Hydrogen \nand Natural Gas) and the associated \ndelivery infrastructure, to enable \nviability of such technologies at scale. \nThe relatively low level of embedded \nsteel within the country\u2019s steel intensive \nassets like infrastructure, automotive \nand consumer goods indicates a low \nrate of scrap recovery from the supply \nchain in the medium term as the end-\nof-life steel recovery will take some time \nto mature.  On the other hand, local iron \nore reserves present a more natural and \nviable input for steel making. Carbon \ncapture and storage technologies are \nnascent while technology solutions for \nsubstitution of carbon in blast furnaces \nare at a pilot or concept stage. Finally, \nthere is no regulated market or defined \nallocation of carbon credits to industry \nin India yet, which will have to be the \nfirst step towards creating an economic \nframework and the foundation for the \ninvestment thesis for de-carbonisation.Tata Steel\u2019s transition strategy will \nseek to progressively reduce reliance on \nfossil fuels in India:\nShort-term (upto 2025)\n1.

The \nCompany plans to set up modular EAF \ncapacities to produce long-products \nfacilities utilising scrap, as the scrap \nsupply chain matures. The Company \nhas already signed a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding with the Government \nof Punjab to set up a 0.75MnTPA EAF steel plant at Ludhiana, Punjab at an \ninvestment of \u20b92,600 crore.\nThe two low-CO2 candidate \ntechnologies for ore-based steel \nproduction that is likely to become \nscalable in the mid-term are:  \n(i) retrofitting existing blast  \nfurnace-based facilities with CCUS \nand, (ii) DRI with green hydrogen, \nsupplemented with the installation of \nEAF-type melting facilities for DRI. Tata \nSteel has identified both technologies \nas R&D leadership focus areas and is \nactively engaging with technology \nproviders, academia and other \ncompanies on their development and \nscale-up.\nThe Company has successfully \ncommissioned a pilot 5 tonne per day \nCarbon Capture & Utilisation (CCU) \nplant in Jamshedpur to capture CO2 \nfrom un-combusted blast furnace gas. \nThe captured CO2 is being utilized \nfor water treatment. Tata Steel has \nalso undertaken a trial injection of \nhydrogen gas in \u2018E\u2019 Blast Furnace at \nits Jamshedpur Works in April 2023 \nusing 40% of the injection systems, \nthe first time in the world that such \na large quantity of hydrogen has \nbeen continuously injected in a blast \nfurnace over a period of 4-5 days. This \nwill provide valuable insights into \nthe potential of reduction of fossil \nfuel consumption and CO2 emissions \nupon use of greener fuels in the blast \nfurnace.

It is \nalso expected that during the global \ntransition process, early movers will be \nable to earn premia from sales of green \nsteel products. Tata Steel is focussed on \nincreasing the share of advanced high \nstrength and green steel in its product \nportfolio.\nGreen Infrastructure:  \nThe generation and use of green \nelectricity depend in part on the \nferromagnetic properties of steel and \nits alloys. Steel is a key input material \nfor wind turbines, transmission \nand distribution infrastructure, \nhydropower, nuclear power plants \netc., energy storage (steel for battery \nmanufacturing), and transportation of \ngreen fuel (e.g., steel for pipelines for \ndelivery of green hydrogen). Tata Steel \nis looking to grow and align its portfolio \nto be able to support the demand from \nthe green industrial revolution. \nCost Reduction and Optimisation \nOpportunities:  \nTata Steel is actively increasing its \nrenewable energy capacity installations \nand sourcing to replace thermal  \npower generated from fossil fuels.  \nDe-carbonisation will enable the \ncompany to achieve savings in compliance costs associated with \nemissions trading schemes, especially \nin Europe. The Company should be \nalso able to bring about reductions \nin cost and availability of financing \nafter implementation of a sustainable \nfinance framework.\nE.

These \nwere originally derived from the GHG \nProtocol methodology (below) and \nare designed specifically for and been \nwidely adopted by the steel sector. \nThe guidelines provide for site wise \nemission reporting by steel companies \nbased on common definitions and \nagreed boundaries. The data collection \nprogramme enables individual steel \nplants to compare themselves against \nboth average and best performance in \nthe sector and identify the scope for \nimprovement.\nHowever, over time, the emission \nreporting landscape has evolved, \nand investors and global reporting standards have been coalescing \nbehind emission reporting based on \nthe original Greenhouse Gas Protocol \n(GHG Protocol) methodology. The \nGHG Protocol is sector agnostic and \nenables investors in their capital \nallocation decision making across \nsectors. It has been prepared by World \nResources Institute and World Business \nCouncil for Sustainable Development \nand is the world's most widely used \ngreenhouse gas accounting standards \nfor companies. The use of GHG \nProtocol has also been recommended \nfor use by the draft standards issued \nby the International Sustainability \nStandards Boards (ISSB) under the IFRS \nFoundation, the Science Based Target \ninitiative (SBTi) and CDP (formerly \nCarbon Disclosure Protocol). It is further \nexpected that the ISSB standards (once \nissued), which require reporting as per \nthe GHG Protocol, would be adopted by \nmarket regulators across the world for \ngreenhouse gas emission reporting.\nCertain aspects of the WSA \nguidelines deviated from the wider \nGHG Protocol in order to enhance \ncomparability across steel making \noperations in different sites:\na. The WSA methodology places a \nboundary of \u2018steel making sites\u2019 on \nemission reporting. Therefore, for \nsteel companies with integrated \noperations, Scope 1 emissions from \nnon-steel making operations (e.g., \nmining sites or downstream facilities) \nare not included in the reported emission. GHG Protocol requires \nreporting of all emissions from all \nsites of the disclosing entity.\nb. The WSA methodology considers \nelectricity emission factors based on a \nglobal average and does not include \nactual emission factor based on the \nsource of power being supplied \nto the steel making site. The GHG \nProtocol, through the use of market-\nbased emission factors for electricity, \nincludes emissions based on the \nsource of power generation assets \nsupplying to the steel making sites.\nc.  The WSA methodology provides for \ncredits against embedded emissions \nin an entity\u2019s primary products, \nbased on its sale of by-products (e.g., \nsale of steel slag and process gases). \nThese credits are not available under \nthe GHG Protocol.\nd. The GHG Protocol provides for \nreporting of Scope 3 emissions \nagainst a longer list of 15 different \ncategories.\ne.  The WSA methodology takes into \naccount only CO2 emissions. The GHG \nProtocol takes into account all Kyoto \nProtocol Greenhouse Gas (CH4, N2O, \nHFC, PFC, SF6 & NF3).\nRecognising the likely changes in \nreporting methodologies in future,  \nTata Steel has started reporting its \nemission as per the GHG Protocol \nfrom FY2021-22 onwards. To ensure \ncomparability against peer sites, Tata \nSteel will also continue to report its \nemission intensity as per the WSA methodology. As a responsible steel \ncompany, Tata Steel is also deeply \nengaged with SBTi on their ongoing \nreview of target setting methodologies \nfor the steel industry as we await the \npublication of the final methodology, \nexpected in Q2 of FY2023-24.

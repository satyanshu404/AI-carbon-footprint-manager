Used by \nover 10,000 organizations across more \nthan 100 countries \u2013 including 73% of \nthe world\u2019s 250 largest companies \u2013 \nthe GRI Standards stand as the most \nwidely adopted sustainability reporting \nstandards worldwide. This holds true \nfor Indian subcontinent as well. As \noutlined in our linkage document on \nutilizing the GRI Standards for reporting \nunder the SEBI Business Responsibility \nSustainability Reporting (BRSR) \nframework, GRI already covers the \nmajority of disclosure requirements, \nsimplifying the reporting process for \nIndian organizations.\nGRI data reveals that there were a \ntotal of 22,464 downloads of the GRI \nStandards by users in India. The top \n15 downloaded Topic Standards in the \nSouth Asian Region from the previous \nyear not only reflect the widespread \nadoption of these standards but also \nhighlight that companies report on \na broader range of sustainability \nissues, placing increasing emphasis \non social topics. Key topics of \ngrowing interest include effluents \nand water, occupational health and \nsafety, emissions, energy, materials, \nbiodiversity, employment practices, \nprocurement practices, and more.\nAt the COP26 climate summit last \nyear, India garnered significant \nattention. Prime Minister Narendra \nModi committed to reducing the \ncountry\u2019s emissions to achieve net-zero status by 2070, marking a significant \nshift from India\u2019s former status as \nthe world\u2019s third-largest polluter. In \npractical terms, this means that India \nneeds to source half of its energy from \nrenewable sources by the end of this \ndecade. Such promises amplify the \nneed for standardized and comparable \ninformation reporting, enhancing \nstakeholder decision-making while \npreventing greenwashing and selective \ndisclosure by companies. This is where \nthe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) \ncomes into play\nCurrently, there are two significant \ndevelopments happening in the \nsustainability reporting landscape.\n \nOne, the European Sustainability \nReporting Standards (ESRS) have \nbeen created by the EU for a multi-\nstakeholder audience, including \ninvestors. \nAnd two, the standards for disclosing \nsustainability-related financial \ninformation are being drafted by \nthe IFRS (International Financial \nReporting Standards) Foundation. \nWe are exploring how the two sets of \nstandards can work together to reduce \nthe corporate reporting burden for users \nand enhance the quality, consistency, \ncomparability, and credibility of \nglobal sustainability reporting for key \nstakeholders, including investors.\nIt\u2019s important to note that stakeholders, \nincluding investors, have made it clear \nthat focusing solely on financial impact \nand enterprise value creation will not \nfully explain an organization\u2019s efforts on behalf of the climate and society. This \nis precisely why the GRI standards have \nbeen valued for 26 years. They enable \norganizations to identify, prioritize, and \nbe transparent about their impacts on the \neconomy, environment, and society. GRI \nis at the centre of global convergence in \nstandards for reporting the impacts of an \norganization on the world and society. \nThrough GRI\u2019s comprehensive reporting \nframework, we enable organisations to \nidentify, prioritize and be transparent about \ntheir economy, environment and society.\nThe primary impact of sustainability reports \nand the associated process is to create \ntransparency in the market.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4336, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3d803c8-697a-4d1f-a1b6-c4da8c21569b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3d803c8-697a-4d1f-a1b6-c4da8c21569b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"document_title": "\"Corporate Sustainability and Circular Economy Initiatives in South Asia: Case Studies and Insights on Leading Companies\"", "prev_section_summary": "### Summary:\n\nThe section titled \"Corporate Sustainability and Circular Economy Initiatives in South Asia: Case Studies and Insights on Leading Companies\" highlights various corporate sustainability initiatives in the South Asia region.
